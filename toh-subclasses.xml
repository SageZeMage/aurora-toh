    <description>Path of Booming Magnificence (ToH)

### Level 3: Path of Booming Magnificence
Barbarians who walk the Path of Booming Magnificence strive to be as lions among their people: symbols of vitality, majesty, and courage. They serve at the vanguard, leading their allies at each charge and drawing their opponents' attention away from more vulnerable members of their group. As they grow more experienced, members of this path often take on roles as leaders or in other integral positions.

### Level 3: Roar of Defiance
Beginning at 3rd level, you can announce your presence by unleashing a thunderous roar as part of the bonus action you take to enter your Rage. Until the beginning of your next turn, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that can hear you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.

Until the Rage ends, if a creature within 5 feet of you that heard your Roar of Defiance deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to bellow at them. Your attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The damage you deal with this feature increases to 2d6 at 10th level. Once a creature takes damage from this feature, you can't use this feature on that creature again.

### Level 3: Running Leap
At 3rd level, while you are raging, you can leap further. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap a number of feet equal to your Strength score. With a 10-foot running start, you can long jump a number of feet equal to twice your Strength score

### Level 6: Lion's Glory
Starting at 6th level, when you enter your Rage, you can choose a number of allies that can see you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Until therage ends, when a chosen ally makes a melee weapon attack, the ally gains a bonus to the damage roll equal to the Rage Damage bonus you gain, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Resonant Bellow
At 10th level, your roars can pierce the fog of fear. As a bonus action, you can unleash a mighty roar, ending the frightened condition on yourself and each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you  and who can hear you. Each creature that ceases to be frightened gains 1d12 + your Charisma modifier (minimum +1) temporary hit points for 1 hour. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Victorious Roar
At 14th level, you exult in your victories. When you hit with at least two attacks on the same turn, you can use a bonus action to unleash a victorious roar. One creature you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to:

On a failure, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your barbarian level and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half the damage and isn't frightened.</description>

    <supports>Primal Path</supports>
    <description>Path of Hellfire (ToH)

### Level 3: Path of Hellfire
Devils have long been known to grant power to mortals as part of a pact or bargain. While this may take the form of unique magic or boons, those who follow the Path of Hellfire are gifted with command over the fires of the Lower Planes, which they channel for short periods to become powerful and furious fighting machines.

While some of these barbarians are enlisted to support the devils' interests as soldiers or enforcers, some escape their devilish fates, while others still are released after their term of service.

### Level 3: Hellish Aspect
Beginning at 3rd level, when you enter your Rage, you take on minor fiendish aspects. The way these aspects manifest is up to you and can include sprouting horns from your head, changing the color of your skin, growing fangs or a tail, or other small physical changes. Though infused with fiendish power, you aren't a fiend. While raging, you have resistance to fire damage, and the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes 1d6 extra fire damage. This damage increases to 2d6 at 10th level.

### Level 6: Hell's Vengeance
At 6th level, you can use your hellfire to punish enemies. If an ally you can see within 60 feet of you takes damage while you are raging, you can use your reaction to surround the attacker with hellfire, dealing fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus to it.

### Level 10: Hellfire Shield
Starting at 10th level, when you enter your Rage, you can surround yourself with flames. This effect works like the fire shield spell, except you are surrounded with a warm shield only and it ends when yourrage ends. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Devilish Essence
At 14th level, while raging, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and if you take damage from a spell, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points to your barbarian level.</description>

    <supports>Primal Path</supports>
    <description>Path of Mistwood (ToH)

### Level 3: Path of Mistwood
The first barbarians that traveled the path of mistwood were elves who expanded upon their natural gifts to become masters of the forests. Over time, members of other races who saw the need to protect and cherish the green places of the world joined and learned from them. Often these warriors haunt the woods alone, only seen when called to action by something that would despoil their home.

### Level 3: Bonus Proficiency
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Stealth skill. If you are already proficient in Stealth, you gain proficiency in another barbarian class skill of your choice.

### Level 3: Mistwood Defender
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Reckless Attack feature on ranged weapon attacks with thrown weapons, and, while you aren't within melee range of a hostile creature that isn't incapacitated, you can draw and throw a thrown weapon as a bonus action.

In addition, when you make a ranged weapon attack with a thrown weapon using Strength while raging, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to the damage you deal with the thrown weapon.

### Level 6: From the Mist
Beginning at 6th level, mist and fog don't hinder your vision. In addition, you can cast the misty step spell, and you can make one attack with a thrown weapon as part of the same bonus action immediately before or immediately after you cast the spell. You can cast this spell while raging. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Mist Dance
Starting at 10th level, when you use the Attack action while raging, you can make one attack against each creature within 5 feet of you in place of one of your attacks. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 14: War Band's Passage
Starting at 14th level, when you use your From the Mist feature to cast misty step, you can bring up to two willing creatures within 5 feet of you along with you, as long as each creature isn't carrying more than its carrying capacity. Attacks against you and any creatures you bring with you have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.</description>

    <supports>Primal Path</supports>
    <description>Path of the Dragon (ToH)

### Level 3: Path of the Dragon
Few creatures embody the power and majesty of dragons. By walking the path of the dragon, you don't solely aspire to emulate these creatures—you seek to become one. The barbarians who follow this path  often do so after surviving a dragon encounter or are raised in a culture that worships them. Dragons tend to have a mixed view of the barbarians who choose this path. Some dragons, in particular the metallic dragons, view such a transformation as a flattering act of admiration. Others may recognize or even fully embrace them as useful to their own ambitions. Still others view this path as embarrassing at best and insulting at worst, for what puny, two-legged creature can ever hope to come close to the natural ferocity of a dragon? When choosing this path, consider what experiences drove you to such a course. These experiences will help inform how you deal with the judgment of dragons you encounter in the world.

### Level 3: Totem Dragon
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you choose which type of dragon you seek to emulate. You can speak and read Draconic, and you are resistant to the damage type of your chosen dragon.

### Level 3: Wyrm Teeth
At 3rd level, your jaws extend and become dragon-like when you enter your Rage. While raging, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with your bite against one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. You are proficient with the bite. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier + damage of the type associated with your totem dragon equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Level 6: Legendary Might
Starting at 6th level, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting. When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature twice between long rests.

### Level 10: Aspect of the Dragon
At 10th level, you take on additional draconic features while raging. When you enter your  Rage, choose one of the following aspects to manifest.

You gain temporary hit points to 1d12 + your barbarian level. Once you manifest this aspect, you must finish a resting before you can manifest it again.

Scales sprout across your skin. Your Armor Class increases by 2.

Your senses become those of a dragon. You have blindsight out to a range of 60 feet.

 You sprout a pair of wings that resemble those of your totem dragon. While the wings are present, you have a Flying Movement of 30 feet. You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless it is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

### Level 14: Wyrm Lungs
At 14th level, while raging, you can use an action to make a breath weapon attack. You exhale your breath in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw:

taking 12d8 damage of the type associated with your totem dragon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Path of the Herald" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_barbarian_Path_of_the_Herald">
    <supports>Primal Path</supports>
    <description>Path of the Herald (ToH)

### Level 3: Path of the Herald
In northern lands, the savage warriors charge into battle behind chanting warrior-poets. These wise men and women collect the histories, traditions, and accumulated knowledge of the people to preserve and pass on. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Herald lead their people into battle, chanting the tribe's sagas and spurring them on to new victories while honoring the glory of the past.

### Level 3: Oral Tradition
When you adopt this path at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in History and Performance. If you already have proficiency in one of these skills, your proficiency bonus is doubled for ability checks you make using that skill.

### Level 3: Battle Fervor
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, when you enter a Rage, you can expend one additional daily use of rage to allow a number of willing creatures equal to half your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you to enter a rage as well. A target must be able to see and hear you to enter this rage. Each target gains the benefits and restrictions of the barbarianrage class feature. In addition, the rage ends early on a target if it can no longer see or hear you.

### Level 6: Lorekeeper
As a historian, you know how much impact the past has on the present. At 6th level, you can enter a trance and explore your people's sagas to cast the augury, comprehend languages, or identify spell, but only as aritual. After you cast a spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Bolstering Chant
At 10th level, when you end your Rage as a bonus action, you regain a number of hit points equal to your barbarian level × 3. Alternatively, if you end yourrage and other creatures are also raging due to your Battle Fervor feature, you and each creature affected by your Battle Fervor regains a number of hit points equal to your barbarian level + your Charisma modifier.

### Level 14: Thunderous Oratory
At 14th level, while you are raging, your attacks deal an extra 2d6 thunder damage. If a creature is raging due to your Battle Fervor feature, its weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 thunder damage. In addition, when you or a creature affected by your Battle Fervor scores a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw:

or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone in addition to any extra damage from the critical hit.</description>

    <supports>Primal Path</supports>
    <description>Path of the Inner Eye (ToH)

### Level 3: Path of the Inner Eye
The barbarians who follow the Path of the Inner Eye elevate their rage beyond anger to glimpse premonitions of the future.

### Level 3: Anticipatory Stance
When you choose this path at 3rd level, you can't be Surprise unless you are incapacitated, and attacks against you before your first turn have disadvantage. If you take damage before your first turn, you can enter a rage as a reaction, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from the triggering attack.

When you reach 8th level in this class, you get 1 extra reaction on each of your turns. This extra reaction can be used only for features granted by the Path of the Inner Eye, such as Insightful Dodge or Preemptive Parry. When you reach 18th level in this class, this increases to 2 extra reactions on each of your turns.

### Level 6: Insightful Dodge
Beginning at 6th level, when you are hit by an attack while raging, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet. If this movement takes you beyond the range of the attack, the attack misses instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Foretelling Tactics
Starting at 10th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack while raging, up to two creatures of your choice who can see and hear you can each use a reaction to immediately move up to half its speed toward the creature you hit and make a single melee or ranged weapon attack against that creature. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Preemptive Parry
At 14th level, if you are raging and a creature you can see within your reach hits another creature with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the attack and use the lower of the two rolls. If the result is still a hit, reduce the damage dealt by your weapon damage die + your Strength modifier.</description>

  <element name="Path of Thorns" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_barbarian_Path_of_Thorns">
    <supports>Primal Path</supports>
    <description>Path of Thorns (ToH)

### Level 3: Path of Thorns
Path of Thorns barbarians use ancient techniques developed by the druids of old that enable them to grow thorns all over their body. The first barbarians of this path fought alongside these druids to defend the natural order. In the centuries since, the knowledge of these techniques has spread, allowing others access to this power.

Though named for the thorns that covered the first barbarians to walk this path, current followers of this path can display thorns, spines, or boney growths while raging.

### Level 3: Blossoming Thorns
Beginning at 3rd level, when you enter your Rage, hard, sharp thorns emerge over your whole body, turning your unarmed strikes into dangerous weapons. When you hit with an unarmed strike while raging, your unarmed strike deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, while raging, when you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

The unarmed strike damage you deal while raging increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 8th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.

### Level 3: Thorned Grasp
Also at 3rd level, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature while raging, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds, and it takes 1d4 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns, provided you continue to grapple the creature and are raging. When you reach 10th level in this class, this damage increases to 2d4.

### Level 6: Nature's Blessing
At 6th level, the thorns you grow while raging become more powerful and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you are hit by a melee weapon attack by a creature within 5 feet of you while raging, that creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. When you reach 10th level in this class, this damage increases to 2d4.

Alternatively, while raging, you can use your reaction to disarm a creature that hits you with a melee weapon while within 5 feet of you by catching its weapon in your thorns instead of the attacker taking damage from your thorns. The attacker must succeed on a Strength saving throw:

or drop the weapon it used to attack you. The weapon lands at its feet. The attacker must be wielding a weapon for you to use this reaction.

### Level 10: Toxic Infusion
Starting at 10th level, when you enter your Rage or as a bonus action while raging, you can infuse your thorns with toxins for 1 minute. While your thorns are infused with toxins, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with an unarmed strike must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Thorn Barrage
At 14th level, you can use an action to shoot the thorns from your body while raging. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving  throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus), taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="College of Echoes" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_bard_College_of_Echoes">
    <supports>Bard College</supports>
    <description>College of Echoes (ToH)

### Level 3: College of Echoes
In the caverns beneath the surface of the world, sound works differently. Your exposure to echoes has taught you about how sound changes as it moves and encounters obstacles. Inspired by the effect caves and tunnels have on sounds, you have learned to manipulate sound with your magic, curving it and altering it as it moves. You can silence the most violent explosions, you can make whispers seem to reverberate forever, and you can even change the sounds of music and words as they are created.

### Level 3: Echolocation
When you join the College of Echoes at 3rd level, you learn how to see with your ears as well as your eyes. As long as you can hear, you have blindsight out to a range of 10 feet, and you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deafened you. At 14th level, your blindsight is now out to a range of 15 feet, and you no longer have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deafened you.

### Level 3: Alter Sound
At 3rd level, you can manipulate the sounds of your speech to mimic any sounds you've heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check.

In addition, you can manipulate some of the sounds around you. You can use your reaction to cause one of the following effects.

You can increase the volume of a sound originating within 30 feet of you, doubling the range it can be heard and granting creatures in range of the sound advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the sound. In addition, when a hostile creature within 30 feet of you takes thunder damage, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and increase the thunder damage by an amount equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.

 You can decrease the volume of a sound originating within 30 feet of you, halving the range it can be heard and granting creatures in range of the sound disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the sound. In addition, when a friendly creature within 30 feet of you takes thunder damage, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and decrease the thunder damage by an amount equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die

You can change 1 word or up to 2 notes within 30 feet of you to another word or other notes. You can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to change a number of words within 30 feet of you equal to 1 + the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die, or you can change a number of notes of a melody within 30 feet of you equal to 2 + double the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. A creature that can hear the sound can notice it was altered by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. At your GM's discretion, this effect can alter sounds that aren't words or melodies, such as altering the cries of a young animal to sound like the roars of an adult.

When a spellcaster casts a spell with verbal components within 30 feet of you, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to disrupt the sounds of the verbal components. The spellcaster must succeed on a concentration check (DC 8 + the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die) or the spell fails and has no effect. You can disrupt a spell only if it is of a spell level you can cast.

### Level 6: Resounding Strikes
Starting at 6th level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapons attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal thunder damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d6. The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal.

### Level 14: Reverberating Strikes
At 14th level, your Bardic Inspiration infuses your allies' weapon attacks with sonic power. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made, and all of the damage from that attack becomes thunder damage. The target of the attack must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked prone.</description>

    <supports>Bard College</supports>
    <description>College of Investigation (ToH)

### Level 3: College of Investigation
Bards pick up all sorts of information as they travel the land. Some bards focus on a certain type of information, like epic poetry, love ballads, or bawdy drinking songs. Others, however, turn to the shadowy occupation of investigating crimes. These bards use their knack for gathering information to learn about criminals and vigilantes, their tactics, and their weaknesses. Some work with agents of the law to catch criminals, but shadier members of this college use their dark knowledge to emulate the malefactors they have studied for so long.

### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of Investigation at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight skill and in two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Deception, Investigation, Performance, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.

### Level 3: Quick Read
At 3rd level, your knowledge of underhanded tactics allows you to gain insight into your foes' strategies. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to make a Wisdom (Insight) check against one creature you can see within 30 feet contested by the creature's Charisma (Deception) check. Add the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die to the result of your check. You have disadvantage on this check if the target is not a humanoid, and the check automatically fails against creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or lower. On a success, you gain one of the following benefits:

The target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you for 1 minute.
You have advantage on saving throws against the target's spells and magical effects for 1 minute.
You have advantage on attack rolls against the target for 1 minute.

### Level 6: Bardic Instinct
Starting at 6th level, you can extend your knowledge of criminal behavior to your companions. When a creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you is damaged by a hostile creature's attack, it can use its reaction to roll that die and reduce the damage by twice the number rolled. If this reduces the damage of the attack to 0, the creature you inspired can make one melee attack against its attacker as part of the same reaction.

### Level 14: Hot Pursuit
Starting at 14th level, when a creature fails a saving throw against one of your bard spells, you can designate it as your mark for 24 hours. You know the direction to your mark at all times unless it is within an antimagic field, it is protected by an effect that prevents scrying such as nondetection, or there is a barrier of lead at least 1 inch thick between you.

In addition, whenever your mark makes an attack roll, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to subtract the number rolled from the mark's attack roll. Alternatively, whenever you make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect from your mark, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to add the number rolled to your saving throw. You can choose to expend the Bardic Inspiration after the attack or saving throw is rolled but before the outcome is determined.</description>

    <description>College of Shadows (ToH)

### Level 3: College of Shadows
Some bards are as proficient in the art of espionage as they are in poetry and song. Their primary medium is information and secrets, though they are known to slip a dagger between ribs when necessary. Masters of insight and manipulation, these bards use every tool at their disposal in pursuit of their goals, and they value knowledge above all else. The more buried a secret, the deeper they delve to uncover it. Knowledge is power; it can cement empires or topple dynasties.

College of Shadows bards undergo careful training before they're sent out into the world. Skilled in both music and manipulation, they're the perfect blend of charm and cunning. The tricks they learn in their tutelage make them ideal for the subtle work of coaxing out secrets, entrancing audiences, and dazzling the minds of their chosen targets.

### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of Shadows at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Stealth and in two other skills of your choice.

### Level 3: Mantle of Shadows
Starting at 3rd level, while you are in Vision and Light, you can use an action to twist the shadows around you for 1 minute or until your concentration ends. For the duration, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can take the Dash action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

### Level 6: Cunning Insight
Starting at 6th level, you know exactly where to hit your enemies. You can use an action to focus on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. You can use this feature as a bonus action if you expend a Bardic Inspiration die. If you do, roll the die and subtract the number rolled from the target's saving throw roll. If the target fails the saving throw, choose one of the following:

You have advantage on your next attack roll against the target.
You know the target's damage vulnerabilities
You know the target's damage resistances and damage immunities.
You know the target's condition immunities.
You see through any illusions obscuring or affecting the target for 1 minute.

### Level 14: Shadowed Performance
Starting at 14th level, you are a master at weaving stories and influencing the minds of your audience. If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to make or break a creature's reputation by relaying a tale to an audience through song, poetry, play, or other medium. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids who witnessed the entire performance, up to a number equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a target suffers one of the following (your choice):

For 24 hours, the target believes the tale you told is true and will tell others the tale as if it were truth.
For 1 hour, the target believes someone nearby knows their darkest secret, and they have disadvantage on Charisma, Wisdom, and Intelligence ability checks and saving throws as they are distracted and overcome with paranoia.
The target becomes convinced that you (or one of your allies if you choose to sing the praises of another) are a fearsome opponent. For 1 minute, the target is frightened of you (or your ally), and you (or your ally) have advantage on attack rolls against the target.

A remove curse or greater restoration spell ends this effect early. You can't use this feature again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>College of Sincerity (ToH)

### Level 3: College of Sincerity
Bards of the College of Sincerity know it is easier for someone to get what they want when they mask their true intentions behind a pleasant façade. These minstrels gain a devoted following and rarely lack for company. Some of their devotees go so far as to put themselves at the service of the bard they admire. Though members of the college can be found as traveling minstrels and adventuring troubadours, they gravitate to large urban areas where their silver tongues and mind-bending performances have the greatest influence. Devious rulers sometimes seek out members of the college as counsellors, but the rulers must be wary lest they become a mere pawn of their new aide.

### Level 3: Entourage
When you join the College of Sincerity at 3rd level, you gain the service of two commoner. Your entourage is considered charmed by you and travels with you to see to your mundane needs, such as making your meals and doing your laundry. If you are in an urban area, they act as your messengers and gofers. When you put on a performance, they speak your praises and rouse the crowd to applause. In exchange for their service, you must provide your entourage a place to live and pay the costs for them to share the same lifestyle as you.

Your entourage doesn't join combat or venture into obviously dangerous areas or situations. If you or your companions abuse or mistreat your entourage, they leave your service immediately. If this occurs, you can gain the service of a new entourage by traveling to a different urban area where you must perform at least 1 hour each day for one week.

You gain another commoner at 6th level, and a final one at 14th level. If you prefer, instead of gaining a new commoner at 6th level, one member of your entourage can become a guard. At 14th level, if you have a guard, it can become your choice of a spy or veteran, instead of taking on a new commoner. If one member of your entourage becomes a guard, spy, or veteran, that person accompanies you into dangerous situations, but they only use the Help action to aid you, unless you use a bonus action to direct them to take a specific action. At the GM's discretion, you can replace the guard with another humanoid of CR 1/8 or lower, the spy with another humanoid of CR 1 or lower, and the veteran with another humanoid of CR 3 or lower.

### Level 3: Kind-Eyed Smile
Also at 3rd level, when you cast an enchantment spell, such as charm person, your target remains unaware of your attempt to affect its mind, regardless of the result of its saving throw. When the duration of an enchantment spell you cast ends, your target remains unaware that you enchanted it. If the description of the spell you cast states the creature is aware you influenced it with magic, it isn't aware you enchanted it unless it succeeds on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.

### Level 6: Lingering Presence
Starting at 6th level, if a creature fails a saving throw against an enchantment or illusion spell you cast, it has disadvantage on subsequent saving throws it makes to overcome the effects of your spell. For example, a creature affected by your hold person spell has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes at the end of each of its turns to end the paralyzed effect.

### Level 14: Artist of Renown
At 14th level, you can expend a Bardic Inspiration die to cast an enchantment spell you don't know using one of your spell slots. When you do so, you must be able to meet all of the spell's requirements, and you must have an available spell slot of sufficient level.

You can't use your Font of Inspiration feature to regain Bardic Inspiration dice expended to cast spells with this feature after a resting. Bardic Inspiration dice expended by this feature are regained only after you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>College of Tactics (ToH)

### Level 3: College of Tactics
Bards of the College of Tactics are calculating strategists who scour historical records of famous battles for tricks they can use to give their own troops, and those of their patrons, an edge on the battlefield. Members of this college travel from war zone to combat site and interview the veterans of those engagements, trying to discern how the victors won the day and leveraging that information for their personal glory.

### Level 3: Combat Tactician
When you join the College of Tactics at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shield, and one martial weapon of your choice. In addition, you can use Bardic Inspiration a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1) + your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a resting (or resting if you have the Font of Inspiration feature), as normal.

### Level 3: Setting the Board
Also at 3rd level, you can move your allies into more advantageous positions, just as a general moves troop markers on a map. As a bonus action, you can command up to three willing allies who can see or hear you to use a reaction to move. Each target can move up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 6: Song of Strategy
Beginning at 6th level, you can share your tactical knowledge with your allies in the heat of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and perform one of the following strategies. For the purpose of these strategies, "you" refers to the creature with the Bardic Inspiration die.

If you take the Dodge action, you can make one melee attack against a creature that is within 5 feet of you, adding the number rolled to your attack roll.

If you take damage from a creature, you can use your reaction to make one attack against your attacker, adding the number rolled to your attack roll. You can't use this strategy if the attacker is outside your weapon's normal range or reach.

You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action, increasing your speed by 5 feet × the number rolled.

If you take the Dash action, you can make one melee attack at the end of the movement, adding the number rolled to your attack roll. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is frightened until the start of your next turn.

If you take the Ready action and the trigger for the readied action doesn't occur, you can make one weapon or spell attack roll after all other creatures have acted in the round, adding the number rolled to the attack roll.

If you take the Help action to aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you, the friendly creature can add the number rolled to their attack roll against the target, and each other friendly creature within 5 feet of you has advantage on its first attack roll against the target.

### Level 14: Ablative Inspiration
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a spell or effect that affects an area, such as the fireball spell or a dragon's breath weapon, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration as a reaction to redirect and dissipate some of the spell's power. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your saving throw against the spell. If you succeed on the saving throw, each friendly creature within 10 feet of you is also treated as if it succeeded on the saving throw.</description>

    <description>College of the Cat (ToH)

### Level 3: College of the Cat
Scholars and spies, heroes and hunters: whether wooing an admirer in the bright sunlight or stalking prey under the gentle rays of the moon, bards of the College of the Cat excel at diverse skills and exhibit contrary tendencies. The adventurous spirits who favor the College of the Cat let their curiosity and natural talents get them into impossible places. Most are skilled, cunning, and vicious enough to extricate themselves from even the most dangerous situations.

### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of the Cat at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Acrobatics and Stealth skills and with thieves' tools if you don't already have them. In addition, if you're proficient with a simple or martial melee weapons, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

### Level 3: Inspired Pounce
Also at 3rd level, you learn to stalk unsuspecting foes engaged in combat with your allies. When an ally you can see uses one of your Bardic Inspiration dice on a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed and make one melee weapon attack against that creature. You gain a bonus on your attack roll equal to the result of the spent Bardic Inspiration die.

When you reach 6th level in this class, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and when you use Inspired Pounce, you can move up to your speed as part of the reaction.

### Level 6: My Claws Are Sharp
Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. In addition, when you use two-weapon fighting to make an attack as a bonus action, you can give a Bardic Inspiration die to a friendly creature within 60 feet of you as part of that same bonus action.

### Level 14: Catlike Tread
Starting at 14th level, while a creature has one of your Bardic Inspiration dice, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. When you have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</description>

    <supports>Divine Domain</supports>
    <description>Black Powder Domain (ToH)

### Level 1: Black Powder Domain
The Black Powder domain focuses on the explosive, unpredictable, and destructive capacity of black powder. Deities with a vested interest in alchemy or deities who revel in destruction can claim influence over this domain. Deities of destruction need not be evil; such gods may represent natural chaos and destruction, reveling just as much in the unpredictable destructive capacity of black powder as in the chaotic destruction wrought by a volcanic eruption. In areas where warfare involves alchemical weapons or firearms, gods of war might also claim influence over this domain.

### Level 1: Domain Spells


### Level 1: Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies or gunsmith's tools (your choice). You also gain proficiency with all simple and martial weapons that have the gunpowder weapon property (see the Adventuring Gear chapter), and when throwing an item with the gunpowder weapon property, such as a bomb, you don't treat the item as an improvised weapon.

### Level 1: Gunpowder Blessing
Also at 1st level, you can use an action to touch a weapon held by a willing creature. The weapon gains the Gunpowder Burst weapon property. This blessing lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.

### Level 2: Channel Divinity: Imbue/Remove Explosivity
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the power of black powder, infusing it into the weapons of allies to make them more deadly, or revoke your god's blessing, lessening the effects of enemy firearms.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke explosive energy that instills your Gunpowder Blessing on one weapon possessed by each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you for 1 minute.

Alternatively, you can curse a number of weapons with the Gunpowder Burst weapon property equal to your proficiency bonus within 30 feet of you for 1 minute. Each affected weapon loses the ability to experience a Gunpowder Burst for the duration. A remove curse spell cast on the weapon restores its full function.

### Level 6: Explosive Infusion
Beginning at 6th level, you can imbue an object you are holding or carrying with explosive power. The object must be nonmagical and small enough to fit in one hand, such as a glass vial or a ball bearing. As a bonus action, you can expend a 1st-level spell slot to fill the item with explosive power for 1 minute. Before the duration ends, you can use an action to throw the object at a point you can see up to 20 feet away, where it explodes on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage can experience Gunpowder Burst, as described in the Gunpowder Burst weapon property, but this effect counts as a single effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can Gunpowder Burst, regardless of the number of targets affected.

If you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. If you expend a use of your Channel Divinity as part of the action to throw the object, each creature within 20 feet of the point of impact must make the saving throw. If you don't throw the object before the duration ends, the magic fades, and the item becomes a normal object once again.

### Level 8: Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Level 17: Greater Explosive Infusion
Starting at 17th level, you can imbue explosive power into larger objects with your Explosive Infusion. The target must be an object that isn't being worn or carried at the time you imbue it, must be no larger than can fit in a single 5-foot cube, and must be nonmagical. Your infusion fills the object with explosive power for 10 minutes. Before the duration ends, you can detonate the object as an action, provided you are within 100 feet of it. Alternatively, you can detonate the object as a reaction to a specific event (a particular creature or certain number of creatures move within 20 feet of the object, for example), or you can set a specific time for the object to detonate, up to 10 minutes from the time at which you infused the object. If you set the object to detonate at a specific time, you don't need to be within 100 feet of the object for it to detonate.

When the object detonates, each creature within 20 feet of the object must make the saving throw. If you expend a use of your Channel Divinity when you first imbue the object, each creature in the area when it detonates has disadvantage on the saving throw. At any point before the object detonates, you can touch it as an action to disperse the energy and cause it to become a normal object once again, regaining the spell slot you expended to infuse the object.</description>

  <element name="Hunt Domain" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_cleric_Hunt_Domain">
    <supports>Divine Domain</supports>
    <description>Hunt Domain (ToH)

### Level 1: Hunt Domain
Many terrible creatures prey on the villages, towns, and inns that dot the forests of Midgard. When such creatures become particularly aggressive or can't be dissuaded by local druids, the settlements often call on servants of gods of the hunt to solve the problem.

Deities devoted to hunting value champions who aid skillful hunters or who lead hunts themselves. Similarly, deities focused on protecting outlier settlements or who promote strengthening small communities also value such clerics. While these clerics might not have the utmost capability for tracking and killing prey, their gods grant them blessings to ensure successful hunts. These clerics might use their abilities to ensure their friends and communities have sufficient food to survive difficult times, or they might enjoy the sport of pursuing and slaying intelligent prey.

### Level 1: Domain Spells


### Level 1: Blessing of the Hunter
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in Survival. You can use your action to touch a willing creature other than yourself to give it advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.

### Level 1: Bonus Proficiency
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.

### Level 2: Channel Divinity: Heart Strike
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to inflict grievous wounds. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can use your Channel Divinity to add +5 to the attack's damage. If you score a critical hit with the attack, add +10 to the attack's damage instead.

### Level 6: Pack Hunter
Starting at 6th level, when an ally within 30 feet of you makes a weapon attack roll against a creature you attacked within this round, you can use your reaction to grant that ally advantage on the attack roll.

### Level 8: Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Level 17: Deadly Stalker
At 17th level, you can use an action to describe or name a creature that is familiar to you or that you can see within 120 feet. For 24 hours or until the target is dead, whichever occurs first, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your target and Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect your target. In addition, you have advantage on weapon attack rolls against the target. You can't use this feature again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Mercy Domain" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_cleric_Mercy_Domain">
    <supports>Divine Domain</supports>
    <description>Mercy Domain (ToH)

### Level 1: Mercy Domain
Mercy can mean promoting healing instead of harm, but it can also mean ending suffering with a quick death. These often-contradictory ideals are the two sides of mercy. The tenets of deities who embody mercy promote ways to end bloody conflicts or deliver healing magics to those in need. While mercy for some may be benevolent, for others it is decidedly not so. More pragmatic mercy gods teach the best method to relieve the agony and torment brought on by monsters and the forces of evil is to bring about the end of that evil.

### Level 1: Domain Spells


### Level 1: Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you take your place on the line between the two aspects of mercy: healing and killing. You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill and with the poisoner's kit. In addition, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and martial weapons.

### Level 1: Threshold Guardian
Also at 1st level, when you hit a creature that doesn't have all of its hit points with a melee weapon attack, the weapon deals extra radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to half your proficiency bonus.

### Level 2: Channel Divinity: Involuntary Aid
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to wrest the lifeforce from an injured creature and use it to heal allies. As an action, you present your holy symbol to one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that doesn't have all of its hit points. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to three times your cleric level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Then, one friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt to the target.

### Level 6: Bolster the Living
At 6th level, you gain the ability to manipulate a portion of the lifeforce that escapes a creature as it perishes. When a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to channel a portion of that energy into a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The friendly creature gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus until the end of its next turn.

### Level 8: Divine Strike of Mercy
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the dual nature of mercy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) to the target. If the target dies from this attack, a friendly creature you can see within 5 feet of you regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt. If no friendly creature is within 5 feet of you, you regain the hit points instead. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d6.

### Level 17: Hand of Grace and Execution
At 17th level, you imbue the two sides of mercy into your spellcasting. Once on each of your turns, if you cast a spell that restores hit points to one creature or deals damage to one creature, you can add your proficiency bonus to the amount of hit points restored or damage dealt.</description>

    <description>Portal Domain (ToH)

### Level 1: Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and either cartographer's tools or navigator's tools (your choice). In addition, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.

### Level 1: Portal Magic
Starting at 1st level, you gain access to spells that connect places or manipulate the space between places. Each spell with "(liminal)" listed alongside its school is a cleric spell for you, even if it doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, and you can prepare it as you would any other spell on the cleric spell list. Liminal spells include bardo, devouring darkness, door of the far traveler, ethereal stairs, hypnagogia, hypnic jerk, mind maze, mirror realm, pierce the veil, reciprocating portal, rive, subliminal aversion, and threshold slip.

### Level 1: Portal Bond
At 1st level, you learn to forge a bond between yourself and another creature. At the end of a resting, you can touch one willing creature, establishing a magical bond between you. While bonded to a creature, you know the direction to the creature, though not its exact location, as long as you are both on the same plane of existence. As an action, you can teleport the bonded creature to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or to the nearest unoccupied space, provided the bonded creature is willing and within a number of miles of you equal to your proficiency bonus. Alternatively, you can teleport yourself to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bonded creature.

Once you teleport a creature in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a resting. You can have only one bonded creature at a time. If you bond yourself to a new creature, the bond on the previous creature ends. Otherwise, the bond lasts until you die or dismiss it as an action

### Level 2: Channel Divinity: Dimensional Shift
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the magic of portals and teleportation. As an action, you teleport a willing target you can see, other than yourself, to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you can see. When you reach 10th level in this class, you can teleport an unwilling target. An unwilling target that succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw is unaffected.

### Level 6: Portal Touch
At 6th level, you can use a bonus action to create a small portal in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. This portal lasts for 1 minute, and it doesn't occupy the space where you create it. When you cast a spell with a range of touch, you can touch any creature within your reach or within 5 feet of the portal. While the portal is active, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the portal up to 30 feet. The portal must remain within 30 feet of you. If you or the portal are ever more than 30 feet apart, the portal fades. You can have only one portal active at a time. If you create another one, the previous portal fades.You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 8: Transpositional Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to imbue your weapon strikes with portal magic. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal damage to the target as normal, and you open a brief portal next to your target or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature takes 1d8 damage of your weapon's type as a duplicate of your weapon lashes out at the creature from the portal. When you reach 14th level, you can choose two creatures, creating a portal next to each and dealing 1d8 damage of your weapon's type to each. Alternatively, you can choose one creature and deal 2d8 damage to it.

### Level 17: Portal Mastery
At 17th level, when you see a creature use a magical gateway, teleport, or cast a spell that would teleport itself or another creature, you can use your reaction to reroute the effect, changing the destination to be an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 100 feet of you. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to use this feature again.</description>

    <description>Serpent Domain (ToH)

### Level 1: Serpent Domain
You embody the deadly, secretive, and mesmerizing nature of serpents. Others tremble at your majesty. You practice the stealth and envenomed attacks that give serpents their dreaded reputation, but you also learn the shedding of skin that has made snakes into symbols of medicine.

### Level 1: Domain Spells


### Level 1: Envenomed
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn the poison spray cantrip. In addition, you gain proficiency in the Deception skill, with a poisoner's kit, and with martial weapons that have the Finesse property.

Beginning at 17th level, as part of a resting, you can assume a new form, your old skin crumbling to dust. You decide what your new form looks like, including height, weight, facial features, vocal tone, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. This feature works like the Change Appearance aspect of the alter self spell, except it lasts until you finish a resting.

In addition, when you are reduced to less than half your hit point maximum, you can end this transformation as a reaction to regain hit points equal to 3 times your cleric level. Once you end the transformation in this way, you can't use this feature to change your appearance again until you finish a resting.</description>

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn the mage hand cantrip and gain proficiency in the Nature skill. When you cast mage hand, you can make the hand invisible, and you can control the hand as a bonus action.

### Level 2: Channel Divinity: Grasp Not the Wind
At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to end the grappled condition on yourself and gain a Flying Movement equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn. You don't provoke opportunity attack while flying in this way.

### Level 6: Stormshield
At 6th level, when you take lightning or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage, including against the triggering attack, until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 8: Divine Strike
At 8th level, you infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Level 17: Dire Tempest
At 17th level, you can create a 20-foot-radius tornado of swirling wind and debris at a point you can see within 120 feet. The storm lasts until the start of your next turn. All Huge or smaller creatures within the area must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage and is thrown 1d4×10 feet into the air. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't thrown into the air. Creatures thrown into the air take Falling as normal and land prone.

In addition, each creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the tornado must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be dragged into the tornado's area. A creature that enters the tornado's area is thrown 1d4×10 feet into the air, taking Falling as normal and landing prone.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Circle of Ash" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_druid_Circle_of_Ash">
    <supports>Druid Circle</supports>
    <description>Circle of Ash (ToH)

### Level 2: Circle of Ash
Druids of the Circle of Ash believe in the power of rebirth and resurrection, both physical and spiritual. The ash they take as their namesake is the result of burning and death, but it can fertilize the soil and help bring forth new life. For these druids, ash is the ultimate symbol of the elegant cycle of life and death that is the foundation of the natural world. Some such druids even use fresh ash to clean themselves, and the residue is often kept visible on their faces.

Druids of this circle often use the phoenix as their symbol, an elemental creature that dies and is reborn from its own ashes. These druids aspire to the same purity and believe resurrection is possible if they are faithful to their beliefs. Others of this circle are drawn to volcanos and find volcanic eruptions and their resulting ash clouds to be auspicious events.

All Circle of Ash druids request to be cremated after death, and their ashes are often given over to others of their order. What later happens with these ashes, none outside the circle know.

### Level 2: Ash Cloud
At 2nd level, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape and, rather than assuming a beast form, create a small, brief volcanic eruption beneath the ground, causing it to spew out an ash cloud. As an action, choose a point within 30 feet of you that you can see. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

This eruption creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of ash centered on the eruption point. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is Vision and Light. When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws until the start of its next turn. Creatures that don't need to breathe or that are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

You automatically succeed on this saving throw while within the area of your ash cloud, but you don't automatically succeed if you are in another Circle of Ash druid's ash cloud.

The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

### Level 2: Firesight
Starting at 2nd level, your vision can't be obscured by ash, fire, smoke, fog, or the cloud created by your Ash Cloud feature, but it can still be obscured by other effects, such as Vision and Light, dense foliage, or rain. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against gas or cloud-based effects, such as from the cloudkill or stinking cloud spells, a gorgon's petrifying breath, or a kraken's ink cloud.

### Level 6: Covered in Ash
At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see (including yourself) takes damage, you can use your reaction to cover the creature in magical ash, giving it temporary hit points to twice your proficiency bonus. The target gains the temporary hit points before it takes the damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

In addition, while your Ash Cloud feature is active and you are within 30 feet of it, you can use a bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within the cloud. You can use this teleportation no more than once per minute.

### Level 10: Feed the Earth
At 10th level, your Ash Cloud feature becomes more potent. Instead of the normal eruption effect, when you first create the ash cloud, each creature within 10 feet of the point you chose must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

In addition, when a creature enters this more potent ash cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws while it remains within the cloud. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe, but creatures that are immune to poison are immune to this effect.

If at least one creature takes damage from the ash cloud's eruption, you can use your reaction to siphon that destructive energy into the rapid growth of vegetation. The area within the cloud becomes difficult terrain that lasts while the cloud remains. You can't cause this growth in an area that can't accommodate natural plant growth, such as the deck of a ship or inside a building.

The ash cloud now lasts for 10 minutes, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

### Level 14: From the Ashes
Beginning at 14th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, your body is consumed in a fiery explosion. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the explosion, your body becomes a pile of ashes.

At the end of your next turn, you reform from the ashes with all of your equipment and half your maximum hit points. You can choose whether or not you reform prone. If your ashes are moved before you reform, you reform in the space that contains the largest pile of your ashes or in the nearest unoccupied space. After you reform, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Circle of Bees" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_druid_Circle_of_Bees">
    <supports>Druid Circle</supports>
    <description>Circle of Bees (ToH)

### Level 2: Circle of Bees
Druids of the Circle of Bees are friends to all stinging insects but focus their attention on honeybees and other pollinating insects. When not adventuring, they tend hives, either created by the insects or by themselves. They tap into the horror inherent in stinging insects to protect their allies or the fields hosting their bee friends.

### Level 2: Circle Spells
Your bond with bees and other stinging beasts grants you knowledge of certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the true strike cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of Bees Spells table.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### Level 2: Bee Bond
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Acrobatics or Stealth skill (your choice), and you can speak and understand Bee Dance, a language shared by bees that involves flying in dance-like patterns. Bees refuse to attack you, even with magical coercion.

When a beast other than a bee attacks you with a weapon that deals poison damage, such as a giant spider's bite or a  scorpion's sting, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on its attack rolls against you until the start of its next turn.

### Level 2: Bee Stinger
Also at 2nd level, you can use an action and expend one use of your Wild Shape to grow a bee's stinger, typically growing from your wrist, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with an unarmed strike while this stinger is active, you use Wisdom instead of Strength for the attack, and your unarmed strike deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier + poison damage equal to half your proficiency bonus, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.The stinger lasts for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down) or until you use your Wild Shape again.

When you reach 6th level in this class, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and the poison damage dealt by your stinger equals your proficiency bonus. In addition, the unarmed strike damage you deal while the stringer is active increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

### Level 6: Bumblebee Rush
At 6th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action. When you do so, creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Hive Mind
At 10th level, when you cast rary's telepathic bond, each creature in the link has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks if at least one creature in the link has proficiency in a skill that applies to that check. In addition, if one creature in the link succeeds on a Wisdom (Perception) check to notice a hidden creature or on a Wisdom (Insight) check, each creature in the link also succeeds on the check. Finally, when a linked creature makes an attack, it has advantage on the attack roll if another linked creature that can see it uses a reaction to assist it.

### Level 14: Mantle of Bees
At 14th level, you can use an action to cover yourself in bees for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). While you are covered in a mantle of bees, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee weapon, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the attacker takes 1d8 piercing damage and 1d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the attacker takes half the damage and isn't poisoned.

While the mantle is active, you can use an action to direct the bees to swarm a 10-foot-radius sphere within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 4d6 piercing damage and 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. The bees then disperse, and your mantle ends.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to create the mantle again.</description>

  <element name="Circle of Crystals" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_druid_Circle_of_Crystals">
    <supports>Druid Circle</supports>
    <description>Circle of Crystals (ToH)

### Level 2: Circle of Crystals
Circle of Crystals druids first arose in subterranean environments, where they helped tend giant crystal gardens, but now they can be found most anywhere with access to underground caverns or geothermal activity. These druids view crystals as a naturally occurring form of order and perfection, and they value the crystals' slow growth cycle, as it reminds them the natural world moves gradually but eternally. This teaches young druids patience and assures elder druids their legacy will be carried on in each spire of crystal. As druids of this circle tend their crystals, they learn how to use the harmonic frequencies of different crystals to create a variety of effects, including storing magic.

### Level 2: Resonant Crystal
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn to create a special crystal that can take on different harmonic frequencies and properties. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. As a bonus action, you can cause the crystal to shed Vision and Light in a 10-foot radius and Vision and Light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the light as a bonus action.

Whenever you finish a resting, you can attune your crystal to one of the following harmonic frequencies. The crystal can have only one harmonic frequency at a time, and you gain the listed benefit while you are wearing or carrying the crystal. The crystal retains the chosen frequency until you finish a resting.

You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.

You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain concentration on a spell when you take damage.

When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using the resonant crystal as your focus, one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you gains temporary hit points to twice your proficiency bonus. The temporary hit points last for 1 minute.

To create or replace a lost resonant crystal, you must perform a 1-hour ceremony. This ceremony can be performed during a resting, and it destroys the previous crystal, if one existed. If a previous crystal had a harmonic frequency, the new crystal has that frequency, unless you create the new crystal during a resting.

### Level 6: Crystalline Skin
Starting at 6th level, when you take damage, you can use a reaction to cause your skin to become crystalline until the end of your next turn. While your skin is crystalline, you have resistance to cold damage, radiant damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, including to the triggering damage if it is of the appropriate type. You choose the exact color and appearance of the crystalline skin.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Magical Resonance
At 10th level, you can draw on stored magical energy in your Resonant Crystal to restore some of your spent magic. While wearing or carrying the crystal, you can use a bonus action to recover one expended spell slot of 3rd level or lower. If you do so, you can't benefit from the Resonant Crystal's harmonic frequency for 1 minute.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Crystalline Form
At 14th level, as a bonus action while wearing or carrying your Resonant Crystal, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to assume a crystalline form instead of transforming into a beast. You gain the following benefits while in this form:

You have resistance to cold damage, radiant damage, and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Your Resonant Crystal pulses with power, providing you with the benefits of all five harmonic frequencies. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose to activate only the Healing or Vitality harmonic frequencies or both. If you activate both, you can choose two different targets or the same target.

This feature lasts 1 minute, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.</description>

  <element name="Circle of Sand" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_druid_Circle_of_Sand">
    <supports>Druid Circle</supports>
    <description>Circle of Sand (ToH)

### Level 2: Circle of Sand
The Circle of Sand originally arose among the desert dunes, where druids forged an intimate connection with the sands that surrounded them. Now such circles gather anywhere with excess sand, including coastlines or badlands.

While the unacquainted might view sand as lifeless and desolate, druids of this circle know the truth—there is life within the sand, as there is almost anywhere. These druids have witnessed the destructive power of sand and the sandstorm and know to fear and respect them. Underestimating the power of sand is only for the foolish.

### Level 2: Sand Form
When you join this circle at 2nd level, you learn to adopt a sandy form. You can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Wild Shape feature and transform yourself into a form made of animated sand rather than transforming into a beast form. While in your sand form, you retain your game statistics. Because your body is mostly sand, you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to escape a grapple or the restrained condition.

You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the equipment to move with you if you flow through particularly narrow spaces.

You can stay in your sand form for 10 minutes, or until you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again. While in your sand form, you can use a bonus action to do one of the following:

You launch a blast of abrasive sand at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the creature takes slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

You emit a cloud of fine sand at a creature you can see within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

When you reach 10th level in this class, you can stay in your sand form for 1 hour or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. In addition, the damage of Abrasive Blast increases to 2d8, and the range of Stinging Cloud increases to 10 feet.

### Level 2: Diffuse Form
Also at 2nd level, when you are hit by a weapon attack while in your Sand Form, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 6: Sand Dervish
Starting at 6th level, you can use a bonus action to create a sand dervish in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The sand dervish is a cylinof whirling sand that is 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide. A creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sand dervish must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 slashing damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dervish. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the sand dervish up to 30 feet in any direction. If you ram the dervish into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the dervish's damage, and the dervish stops moving this turn. When you move the dervish, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and float it across pits up to 10 feet wide.The sand dervish lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage dealt by the dervish increases to 2d8.

### Level 10: Echo of the Dunes
At 10th level, your connection with sand deepens, and you can call on the power of the deep dunes to do one of the following:

You can use an action to conjure a 20-foot radius sphere of thick, swirling sand at a point you can see within 90 feet. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is Vision and Light. A creature moving through the area must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. The sphere lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required).

You can use an action to transform into a whirlwind of sand until the start of your next turn. While in this form, your movement speed is doubled, and your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack. While in whirlwind form, you have resistance to all damage, and you can't be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned, but you also can't cast spells, can't make attacks, and can't manipulate objects that require fine dexterity.

Once you use one of these options, you can't use this feature again until you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Sandstorm
At 14th level, you can use an action to create a sandstorm of swirling wind and stinging sand. The storm rages in a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within 120 feet. The storm spreads around corners, its area is Vision and Light, and exposed flames in the area are doused. The buffeting winds and sand make the area difficult terrain. The storm lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.

When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d8 slashing damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

You are immune to the effects of the storm, and you can extend that immunity to a number of creatures that you can see within 120 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Circle of the Green" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_druid_Circle_of_the_Green">
    <supports>Druid Circle</supports>
    <description>Circle of the Green (ToH)

### Level 2: Circle of the Green
Druids of the Circle of the Green devote themselves to the plants and green things of the world, recognizing the role of plants in giving life. By continued communion with plant life, they believe they draw nearer to what they call "The Green," a cosmic thread that binds all plant life. Druids of this circle believe they gain their abilities by tapping into the Green, and they use this connection to summon a spirit from it.

### Level 2: Circle Spells
When you join this circle at 2nd level, you form a bond with a plant spirit, a creature of the Green. Your link with this spirit grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of the Green Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### Level 2: Summon Green Spirit
Starting at 2nd level, you can summon a spirit of the Green, a manifestation of primordial plant life. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon the green spirit rather than assuming a beast form.

The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. When the spirit appears, the area in a 10-foot radius around it becomes tangled with vines and other plant growth, becoming  difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.

The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the green spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.You determine the spirit's appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches and leaves, while others look like creatures with leafy bodies and heads made of gourds or fruit. Some even resemble beasts, only made entirely of plant material.

In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The green spirit can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The spirit remains for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die. When it manifests, the spirit bears 10 fruit that are infused with magic. Each fruit works like a berry created by the goodberry spell.

### Level 6: Gift of the Green
At 6th level, the bond with your Summon Green Spirit enhances your restorative spells and gives you the power to cast additional spells. Once before the spirit's duration ends, you can cast one of the following spells without expending a spell slot or material components: locate animals or plants, pass without trace (only in environments with ample plant life), plant growth, or speak with plants. You can't cast a spell this way again until the next time you summon your green spirit.

Whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points while your green spirit is summoned, roll a d8 and add the result to the total hit points restored.

In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your green spirit.

### Level 10: Verdant Interference
Starting at 10th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you or your Summon Green Spirit is attacked, you can use your reaction to cause vines and vegetation to burst from the ground and grasp at the attacker, giving the attacker disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Spirit Symbiosis
At 14th level, while your Summon Green Spirit is within 30 feet of you, you can use an action to join with it, letting its plant matter grow around you. While so joined, you gain the following benefits:

You gain temporary hit points to your green spirit's current hit points.
You gain a climbing speed of 30 feet.
You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.
The ground within 10 feet of you is difficult terrain for creatures hostile to you.
You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to make a tendril attack against one creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

This feature lasts until the temporary hit points you gained from this feature are reduced to 0, until the spirit's duration ends, or until you use an action to separate. If you separate, the green spirit has as many hit points as you had temporary hit points remaining. If this effect ends because your temporary hit points are reduced to 0, the green spirit disappears until you summon it again.</description>

    <description>Circle of the Shapeless (ToH)

### Level 2: Circle of the Shapeless
Druids of the Circle of the Shapeless believe that oozes, puddings, and jellies serve an important and integral role in the natural world, particularly in decomposition and in clearing detritus. Druids of this circle also admire the adaptability of these gelatinous creatures and study them to learn how to duplicate some of their abilities.

The sworn enemies of Circle of the Shapeless druids are the so-called ooze lords and their servants who pervert the natural order by controlling and weaponizing such creatures.

### Level 2: Circle Spells
When you join this circle at 2nd level, your connection with oozes grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the acid splash cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Shapeless Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### Level 2: Ooze Form
Starting at 2nd level, you learn to adopt an ooze form. You can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to take on an ooze-like form rather than transforming into a beast.

While in your ooze form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes less substantial and appears wet and slimy. Your skin may change in color and appearance, resembling other forms of ooze like black pudding, ochre jelly, gray ooze, or even translucent, like a gelatinous cube.

You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the equipment to move with you if you flow through particularly narrow spaces.

Your ooze form lasts for 10 minutes or until you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

While in ooze form, you gain the following benefits:

Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 acid damage on a hit.

You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

You have a climbing speed of 20 feet.

When a creature touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 acid damage to that creature.

### Level 6: Slimy Pseudopod
At 6th level, you can use a bonus action to cause an oozing pseudopod to erupt from your body for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. On the turn you activate this feature, and as a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, you can make a melee spell attack with the pseudopod against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 acid damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting. When you reach 10th level in this class, the acid damage dealt by your pseudopod increases to 2d6.

### Level 10: Improved Ooze Form
At 10th level, your Ooze Form becomes more powerful. It now lasts 1 hour, and the acid damage dealt by your Acid Weapons and Oozing Form increases to 2d6.

### Level 14: Engulfing Embrace
At 14th level, while in your Ooze Form, you can use an action to move into the space of a creature within 5 feet of you that is your size or smaller and try to engulf it. The target creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.

On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet away from you or to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

On a failed save, you enter the creature's space, and the creature takes 2d6 acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature is restrained and has Cover against attacks and other effects outside of your body. The engulfed creature takes 4d6 acid damage at the start of each of your subsequent turns. When you move, the engulfed creature moves with you.

An engulfed creature can attempt to escape by taking an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of you.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to try to engulf another creature.</description>

    <supports>Druid Circle</supports>
    <description>Circle of the Wind (ToH)

### Level 2: Circle of the Wind
Founded in deserts, badlands, and grasslands, where wind dominates and controls the landscape, the teachings of the Circle of Wind have spread far and wide, like a mighty storm. Druids who follow this circle's teachings embrace the mercurial winds to create several effects.

### Level 2: Bonus Cantrip
At 2nd level when you choose this circle, you learn the message cantrip.

### Level 2: Circle Spells
The magic of the wind flows through you, granting access to certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Wind Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### Level 2: Feathered Form
Starting at 2nd level, when you use your Wild Shape to magically assume the shape of a beast, it can have a flying speed (you ignore "no flying speed" in the Limitations column of the Beast Shapes table but must abide by the other limitations there).

### Level 6: Comforting Breezes
Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you can summon a gentle breeze that extends in a 30-foot cone from you. Choose a number of targets in the area equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You end one disease or the blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned condition on each target. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 6: Updraft
Also at 6th level, you can expend one use of Wild Shape as a bonus action to summon a powerful wind. You and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you end the grappled or restrained conditions. You can fly up to 30 feet as part of this bonus action, and each creature that you affect with this wind can use a reaction to fly up to 30 feet. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack.

### Level 10: Vizier of the Winds
Starting at 10th level, you can ask the winds one question, and they whisper secrets back to you. You can cast commune without preparing the spell or expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Hunger of Storm's Fury
Beginning at 14th level, when you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or effect that deals lightning damage, you take no damage and instead regain a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>Buccaneer (ToH)

### Level 3: Buccaneer
Honing their martial skills in fierce ship-to-ship combat, buccaneers become skilled in both gun and blade, able to lay out opponents with savage shots, while resisting the worst that can be thrown at them.

### Level 3: Black Powder and Sailcloth
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with gunsmith's tools and with water vehicles. You also have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.

### Level 3: Bullet and Blade
At 3rd level, when you engage in two-weapon fighting with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a pistol in your other hand in place of a light melee weapon to make the bonus action attack. While fighting in this fashion, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with the pistol. If your two-weapon fighting bonus action attack is made with a pistol, you can add your Dexterity modifier to the damage of that attack.

### Level 3: Gun Mastery
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain access to special maneuvers that can be enacted when the damage from your firearm attack causes a gunpowder burst (see the Gunpowder Burst in the Adventuring Gear chapter). In addition, the number of times you can roll Gunpowder Burst on a single attack is 1 + your proficiency bonus.

You learn two burst maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed below. You can apply a burst maneuver as a reaction when you gain a Gunpowder Burst on the damage roll of a weapon with the gunpowder property. The maneuver's effect is in addition to the extra damage dice from a Gunpowder Burst. You can apply only one burst maneuver to any given attack, regardless of the number of Gunpowder Burst it has. If the maneuver calls for a saving throw, the DC equals:

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

You learn one additional burst maneuver of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new burst maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

### Level 3: Burst Maneuvers
A creature within 5 feet of you when you fired the shot must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute. This creature doesn't need to be the target of the attack that caused the Gunpowder Burst.

Your weapon's Gunpowder Burst damaged the target's leg, wing, or other ambulatory limb. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or its speed is reduced by 10 feet until it receives magical healing or finishes a resting. This effect is cumulative, but it can't reduce a target's speed to less than 5 feet.

If your target is Large or smaller, the Gunpowder Burst causes the shot to go through your target. If another creature is within 10 feet of the target, and a direct line can be drawn from the creature to you with the original target in between, then the new creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage as if hit by a normal attack from the weapon. This damage can't Gunpowder Burst.

The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone by the Gunpowder Burst.

The power of the Gunpowder Burst empowers you to strike a nearby creature. You can make one melee weapon attack with a melee weapon you are wielding against a creature within your melee weapon's range.

The shot produces a large amount of smoke, Vision and Light your space until the start of your next turn.

Your weapon's Gunpowder Burst causes the target an extreme amount of pain. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn.

The Gunpowder Burst energizes you, causing you to leap into action. You can immediately move up to half your speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack.

The Gunpowder Burst destabilized the target. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on all attacks until the start of your next turn.

### Level 7: Deck Fighter
At 7th level, your training keeps you nimble, allowing you to maintain balance and reflexive responses at the worst of times. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Seasoned Seadog
At 10th level, the damage you deal with gunpowder weapons can Gunpowder Burst when a damage die results in either of the two highest numbers on the die (such as a 5 or 6 on a d6 or a 7 or 8 on a d8), instead of only the highest number on the die.

### Level 15: Unrelenting Spirit
Beginning at 15th level, if you are suffering from one of the following conditions at the start of your turn, you can end the condition as a bonus action: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, or stunned. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to reduce your exhaustion level by 1. You can't use this feature again until you finish a resting.

### Level 18: Vicious Marauder
At 18th level, you become a master of fighting with Bullet and Blade in the thick of combat. When you make a ranged attack with a pistol at a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, you have advantage on the attack roll if you already hit that creature with a melee weapon attack this turn. If you score a critical hit with this attack, you can apply up to two Burst Maneuvers to the attack, provided the damage had at least one Gunpowder Burst.</description>

    <description>Chaplain (ToH)

### Level 3: Chaplain
Militaries and mercenary companies often contain members of various clergies among their ranks. These chaplains typically come from religious sects whose tenets promote war, healing, peace, protection, or freedom, and they tend to the emotional and physical well-being of their charges. In the eyes of your companions, you are as much a counselor and spiritual leader as you are a fellow warrior.

### Level 3: Student of Faith
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight, Medicine, or Religion skill (your choice).

### Level 3: Field Medic
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use an action to spend one of your Hit Dice and regain hit points. The hit points regained with this feature can be applied to yourself or to another creature you touch. Alternatively, you can heal another creature you touch when you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points during a resting, instead of applying the regained hit points to yourself. If you are under an effect that increases the amount of healing you receive when spending Hit Dice, such as a spell or feat, that effect applies to the amount of hit points the target regains. Keep in mind, some effects that increase the healing of Hit Dice happen only when those Hit Dice are spent during a resting, like a bard's Song of Rest (D6).

In addition, the number of Hit Dice you regain after a resting is equal to half your total number of Hit Dice plus one. For example, if you have four Hit Dice, you regain three spent Hit Dice, instead of two, when you finish a resting.

### Level 7: Rally the Troops
Starting at 7th level, you can use an action to urge your companions to overcome emotional and spiritual obstacles. Each friendly creature of your choice that can see or hear you (which can include yourself) ignores the effects of being charmed and frightened for 1 minute.

If a creature affected by this feature is already suffering from one of the conditions it can ignore, that condition is suppressed for the duration and resumes when this feature ends. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

Each target can ignore additional conditions when you reach certain levels in this class: one level of exhaustion and incapacitated at 10th level, up to two levels of exhaustion and stunned at 15th level, and up to three levels of exhaustion and paralyzed at 17th level.

### Level 10: Tend the Injured
At 10th level, if you spend Hit Dice to recover hit points during a resting, any hit points regained that exceed your hit point maximum, or that of the creature being tended to, can be applied to another creature within 5 feet of you. In addition, you regain one spent Hit Die when you finish a resting.

### Level 15: Rally Point
Beginning at 15th level, when a friendly creature you can see takes damage, you can use your reaction to move that creature up to its speed toward you. The creature can choose the path traveled, but it must end the movement closer to you than it started. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 18: Hospitaler
At 18th level, you recover a number of spent Hit Dice equal to a quarter of your total Hit Dice when you finish a resting. In addition, you recover all your spent Hit Dice when you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>Legionary (ToH)

### Level 3: Legionary
A legionary follows the techniques of close-quarters combat developed by soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder with their allies. This style of fighting spread far and wide, finding an honored place among the armies and mercenary companies of other races. True legionaries scoff at the image of the storybook hero standing alone against impossible odds, knowing together they can face any danger and emerge victorious.

### Level 3: Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight, Nature, or Survival skill (your choice).

### Level 3: Coordinated Fighting
Starting at 3rd level, you learn techniques and strategies for close-quarter combat. On your first attack each round, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls if at least one friendly creature is within 5 feet of you.

### Level 3: Move As One
At 3rd level, at any point while moving on your turn, you can command a number of willing, friendly creatures within 5 feet of you up to your proficiency bonus to move with you. Each creature that chooses to move with you can use a reaction to move up to its speed alongside you, remaining within 5 feet of you while moving. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a resting.

### Level 7: Massed Fighting
Starting at 7th level, you learn better techniques and strategies for fighting closely alongside your allies. On your first attack each round, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls for each friendly creature within 5 feet of you, up to a maximum bonus equal to your proficiency bonus.

In addition, when you use your Action Surge feature, each friendly creature within 15 feet of you (except you) gains a +2 bonus to AC and to Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute.

### Level 15: Tactical Positioning
At 15th level, moving through a hostile creature's space is not difficult terrain for you, and you can move through a hostile creature's space even if it is only one size larger or smaller than you. As normal, you can't end your move in a hostile creature's space.

### Level 18: Cooperative Strike
Starting at 18th level, when you use the Attack action and attack with a weapon while at least one friendly creature is within 5 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to make one additional attack with that weapon.</description>

    <description>Pugilist (ToH)

### Level 3: Pugilist
Pugilists live by their fists, bare-knuckle warriors who do not hesitate to throw hands if the situation demands it. They know the intense, close, violent intimacy of melee, and they operate unapologetically in that space. Whether in fighting pits by the docks to make some extra coin, in the king's grand arena as champions of quarreling nobles, or in the employ of local merchants in need of seemingly weaponless guards, pugilists can be found in all rungs of society. Pugilists take pleasure in a battle hard won and thrill in the energy of the fight rather than in a kill. They can often be found celebrating or having drinks with a former opponent hours after the fight, regardless of the bout's winner.

### Level 3: Unarmed Warrior
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to use your fists, knees, elbows, head, and feet to attack your opponents. You gain the following benefits while you are not wearing heavy armor and while you are not wielding weapons or a shield:

Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. Your unarmed strike damage increases as you reach higher levels. The d6 becomes a d8 at 10th level and a d10 at 18th level.
When you use the Attack action to make one or more unarmed strikes, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

Unlike monks and their ki, pugilist fighters don't naturally have a means of making unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Some magic items, such as the cestus (see the Magic Items chapter) or the swolbold wraps (see Vault of Magic), specifically make unarmed strikes magical, but not every campaign includes magic weapons or magic items.

As a GM, if you are running a game in a high-magic setting and would like to give a pugilist player character the opportunity for their unarmed strikes to count as magical, we recommend allowing the pugilist to utilize the magic in their magic items. The pugilist must be attuned to the item, and the item must be worn on the hands, arms, or feet, such as gloves, a ring, bracers, or boots. The amount of magical bonus the pugilist receives depends on the rarity of the item. An uncommon magic item allows the pugilist's unarmed strikes to count as magical, a rare magic item gives the pugilist a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and very rare and legendary magic items give +2 and +3 bonuses, respectively.

### Level 3: Resilient Fighter
Starting at 3rd level, you learn to endure great amounts of physical punishment. You add your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) to any death saving throw you make. In addition, you can use Second Wind a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 7: Uncanny Fortitude
Beginning at 7th level, if damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC: of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

In addition, when you use Second Wind, you now regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level + your Constitution modifier.

### Level 10: Debilitating Blow
At 10th level, when you hit one target with two unarmed strikes in the same turn, you can use a bonus action to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw:

On a failure, the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.

### Level 15: Withstand Death
At 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use Second Wind as a reaction, provided you have uses of Second Wind remaining. You can decide to use this reaction before or after your Uncanny Fortitude feature triggers.

In addition, when you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as one failure instead of two.

### Level 18: Opportunistic Brawler
Starting at 18th level, you might not look for a fight around every corner, but you're ready in case one happens. You have advantage on initiative rolls.

In addition, when a creature you can see enters a space within 5 feet of you, you can make one opportunity attack against the creature. This opportunity attack must be made with an unarmed strike. You have a number of reactions each turn equal to your proficiency bonus, but these reactions can be used only to perform opportunity attack.</description>

### Level 3: Harassing Strike
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, when a creature you can see enters your reach, you can use your reaction to Shove the creature. To use this feature, you must be wielding a glaive, halberd, lance, pike, or spear.

### Level 3: Radiant Fighting
Starting at 3rd level, when you deal damage with a glaive, halberd, lance, pike, or spear, you can choose for the damage to be radiant instead of its normal damage type.

### Level 7: Formation Tactics
At 7th level, you bolster your allies when fighting shoulder to shoulder. While you have an ally within 5 feet of you who isn't incapacitated, you can use a bonus action to take the Help action to assist that ally's attack roll or their next Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

### Level 10: Foe of Darkness
Beginning at 10th level, your faith and training make you a daunting foe of dark creatures. Once per turn, you can have advantage on an attack roll or ability check made against a fiend, undead, or creature of shadow.

### Level 15: Give Ground
Starting at 15th level, once per turn when you are hit by a melee attack, you can choose to move 5 feet away from the attacker without provoking opportunity attack. If you do, the attacker takes 1d6 radiant damage. To use this feature, you must be wielding a glaive, halberd, lance, pike, or spear.

### Level 18: The Sun's Protection
At 18th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. If you fail a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.</description>

### Level 3: Timeblade
here are warriors who move so quickly that they seem to stop time, then there are those who actually alter time with their attacks. The timeblade augments physical attacks by manipulating temporal powers and eventually learns to step outside time itself.

### Level 3: Temporal Strike
Starting at 3rd level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to trigger one of the following effects:

You step outside of time and move to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack. At 10th level, you can move up to 30 feet.

You push the target of your attack to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. You can move the target only horizontally, and before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, the target can make a Strength saving throw:

ending the movement in an unoccupied space next to the damaging terrain on a success. At 10th level, you can move the target up to 30 feet.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 7: Chronologic Echo
At 7th level, immediately after you use your Second Wind feature, you can trigger an echo in time, allowing you to use it twice. Roll separately for each use of Second Wind. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Improved Temporal Strike
At 10th level, when you use your Temporal Strike feature, you can choose one of the following additional options:

You immediately make a weapon attack against a different target within range.

You add your proficiency bonus to your Armor Class until the beginning of your next turn.

### Level 15: Continuity Rift
At 15th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can instantly open a rupture in space-time to swallow the target. The creature disappears and falls through a realm outside of reality.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. It takes 8d8 psychic damage as it grapples with the mind-breaking experience. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or it acts randomly for 1 minute as if under the effects of the confusion spell. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 18: Temporal Warrior
Starting at 18th level, you can momentarily step outside of time to attack your foes. As an action, you can briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4+1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal. This effect works like the time stop spell, except you can make one attack on each of your turns without ending the effect. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

### Level 3: Tunnel Watcher
For untold ages, the dwarves have paid in blood to keep their subterranean homes safe. The keystone to the defense of the dwarven citadels are the tunnel watchers, warriors trained in the tight, uneven paths beneath the surface of the world. While the techniques of the tunnel watchers originated with the dwarves, others see the value in such specialization. Tunnel watchers can thus be found throughout the mountainous regions of the world.

### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with thieves' tools and mason's tools.

### Level 3: First Line of Defense
Starting at 3rd level, a creature that you hit with a melee weapon attack has its speed reduced by 5 feet and can't use the Disengage action until the start of your next turn. You can't reduce a creature's speed by more than 10 feet with this feature.

In addition, when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's type.

### Level 3: Fight for Every Step
At 3rd level, when you take damage from a melee attack, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet away from the attacker, reducing the damage you take from the attack by 1d6 + the number of hostile creatures within 5 feet of the space you left. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack.

The attacker can immediately move into the space you left. This movement doesn't cost the attacker's reaction and doesn't provoke opportunity attack, but a creature can move this way only once each turn.

### Level 7: Safe Passage
Starting at 7th level, you have advantage on saving throws against traps, natural hazards, and lair actions. Traps, natural hazards, and lair actions have disadvantage when they make attack rolls against you.

### Level 10: Steadfast
At 10th level, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that cause the frightened condition and effects that would move you against your will, including teleportation effects. When a hostile creature forces you to make a Strength saving throw and you succeed, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's type the next time you hit with a weapon attack before the end of your next turn.

### Level 15: Cave-In
Starting at 15th level, once on each of your turns when you use the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with a strike against a wall or ceiling within your weapon's reach or range. Creatures other than you within 5 feet of the section of wall or the floor below the ceiling where you strike must make a Dexterity saving throw:

A creature that fails this saving throw takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage and is restrained until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half the damage and isn't restrained. While restrained in this way, a creature has Cover against creatures other than you. When the effect ends, the creature's space becomes difficult terrain.

### Level 18: Against the Tide
Beginning at 18th level, when you use the Attack action and hit more than one creature with a weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your next turn. When you shove more than one creature on your turn, you can use a bonus action to shove one creature within 5 feet of a creature you successfully shoved.</description>

    <description>Way of Concordant Motion (ToH)

### Level 3: Way of Concordant Motion
The monks of Concordant Motion follow a tradition developed and honed by various goblin and kobold clans that favored tactics involving swarming warriors. The tradition combines tactical disciplines designed to encourage groups to work as one unit with practical strategies for enhancing allies. Where many warrior-monks view ki as a power best kept within, the Way of Concordant Motion teaches its followers to project their ki into their allies through ascetic meditation and mental exercises. Followers of this tradition value teamwork and promote functioning as a cohesive whole above any search for triumph or glory.

### Level 3: Cooperative Ki
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you spend Ki on certain features, you can share some of the effects with your allies.

When you spend Ki to use Flurry of Blows, you can use a bonus action to empower up to two allies you can see within 30 feet of you instead of making two unarmed strikes. The next time an empowered ally hits a creature with an attack before the start of your next turn, the ally's attack deals extra damage of the attack's type equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

When you spend Ki to use Patient Defense, you can spend 1 additional Ki point to share this defense with one ally you can see within 30 feet of you. That ally can immediately use the Dodge action as a reaction.

When you spend Ki to use Step of the Wind, you can spend 1 additional Ki point to share your mobility with one ally you can see within 30 feet of you. That ally can use a reaction to immediately move up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack.

### Level 6: Deflect Strike
At 6th level, when an ally you can see within 30 feet is hit by a melee attack, you can spend 2 Ki points as a reaction to move up to half your speed toward the ally. If you move to within 5 feet of the ally, the damage the ally takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If this reduces the damage to 0, you can immediately make one unarmed strike against the attacker.

### Level 11: Coordinated Maneuvers
Starting at 11th level, when you use your Cooperative Ki feature to share your Patient Defense or Step of the Wind, you can target a number of allies equal to your proficiency bonus. You must spend 1 Ki point for each ally you target.

In addition, when you use your Cooperative Ki feature to empower your allies with your Flurry of Blows, you can make two unarmed strikes as part of the same bonus action.

### Level 17: Concordant Mind
At 17th level, you have mastered the ability to empower your allies with your Ki. As an action, you can expend 5 Ki points and empower each ally of your choice within 30 feet of you. Each empowered ally immediately gains the benefits of all three of your Cooperative Ki features. This allows each empowered ally to both move and take the Dodge action as a reaction. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

### Level 3: Way of the Dragon
You have studied at a monastery devoted to dragonkind. Warriors trained in these places adapt their fighting styles to match the dragons they hold in such esteem. They are respected and feared by students of other traditions. Once they are trained, followers of this Way travel far and wide, rarely settling in one place for long.

### Level 3: Draconic Affiliation
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you feel an affinity for one type of dragon, which you choose from the Draconic Affiliation table. You model your fighting style to match that type of dragon, and some of the features you gain from following this Way depend upon the affiliation you chose.

When you make your selection, you gain proficiency in the dragon's associated skill, and you gain resistance to the listed damage type. If you already have this skill proficiency, you double your proficiency bonus with that skill.

### Level 3: Draconic Onslaught
At 3rd level, when you use Step of the Wind then hit with an attack, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation.

### Level 6: Take Flight
Starting at 6th level, when you take the {@action} Dash action, you can spend 1 Ki point to gain a Flying Movement equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn. While you are flying, a creature that hits you with an opportunity attack takes 2d6 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation.

### Level 11: Conquering Wyrm
Beginning at 11th level, when you take the Attack action after using Step of the Wind in the same turn, you can spend an extra 2 Ki points to replace your first attack with one unarmed strike against each creature within 5 feet of the space in which you end your movement. On a hit, your unarmed strike deals an extra 4d6 of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation. You can't use this feature and your Draconic Onslaught feature in the same round.

### Level 17: Scales of the Wyrm
At 17th level, you can harden yourself against harm like the eldest of dragons. On your turn, you can spend 4 Ki points to increase your Armor Class by 2, gain temporary hit points to your monk level, and gain immunity to the frightened condition for 10 minutes. For the duration, when you take damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take from that source to 0.</description>

    <description>Way of the Humble Elephant (ToH)

### Level 3: Way of the Humble Elephant
Like their namesake, monks of the Way of the Humble Elephant are respectful and accommodating. A large part of their training involves traveling through their home region and assisting local farmers and common folk with problems ranging from rebuilding burned homes to dispatching troublesome bandits. In areas where their Way is known, adherents are welcomed into the community and their needs are seen to in exchange for the host of benefits their presence brings to the community.

### Level 3: Slow to Anger
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you use Patient Defense and an attack hits you, you can use your reaction to halve the damage that you take. When you use Patient Defense and a melee attack made by a creature within your reach misses you, you can use your reaction to force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is knocked prone.

When you use either of these reactions, you can spend 1 Ki point. If you do, your first melee weapon attack that hits before the end of your next turn deals extra damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

### Level 6: Unyielding Step
Starting at 6th level, you can spend 1 Ki point on your turn to ignore difficult terrain for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, your speed can't be reduced below 15 feet. If you use this feature while grappled, the creature can use its reaction to move with you whenever you move; otherwise, the grapple ends. If you use this feature while restrained but not grappled, such as by a spider's web, you break free from the restraining material unless it is capable of moving with you.

### Level 11: Decisive in Wrath
At 11th level, when you spend 1 Ki point as part of your Slow to Anger feature, all of your melee weapon attacks that hit before the end of your next turn deal extra damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

### Level 17: Thick Hide
At 17th level, you can spend 5 Ki points as a bonus action to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 10 minutes.</description>

    <description>Way of the Still Waters (ToH)

### Level 3: Way of the Still Waters
Monks who follow the Way of the Still Waters are like placid mountain lakes; they are still and calm until some outside force disrupts them and forces a reaction. Many adherents live a pacifistic lifestyle and never seek conflict. When strife finds them, though, they deal with it in a swift and decisive use of power and grace.

### Level 3: Perfect Calm
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you spend a Ki point on Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, or Step of the Wind, you also have advantage on one saving throw of your choice that you make before the end of your next turn.

### Level 3: Turbulent Waters
Starting at 3rd level, when an attack made by a hostile creature misses you or you succeed on a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a Turbulence die, which is the same type as your Martial Arts die. You can have a maximum number of Turbulence dice equal to your proficiency bonus. When you hit with an attack, you can roll any number of Turbulence dice and add the total result to the damage you deal. Turbulence dice that result in a 1 or 2 are expended, otherwise you don't expend Turbulence dice when you add them to the damage you deal. You lose all accumulated Turbulence dice when you haven't made an attack or been the target of an attack by a hostile creature for 1 minute.

### Level 6: Spreading Ripples
At 6th level, when a creature within 10 feet of you and friendly to you is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a Turbulent Waters.

When you hit with an attack and use two or more Turbulent Waters on the attack's damage, you can choose one creature within 10 feet of your target that you can see. That creature takes damage equal to the roll of one of the Turbulent Waters you rolled. If you spend 1 Ki point, you can instead choose any number of creatures within 10 feet of your target to take that amount of damage.

### Level 11: Duality of Water
Beginning at 11th level, when you have no Turbulent Waters, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, and you have resistance to fire damage. When you have at least one Turbulent Waters, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and you have resistance to cold damage.

### Level 17: Tempestuous Waters
At 17th level, when you spend any number of Ki points, you can also choose to gain an equal number of Turbulent Waters, up to your proficiency bonus.</description>

    <supports>Monastic Tradition</supports>
    <description>Way of the Tipsy Monkey (ToH)

### Level 3: Way of the Tipsy Monkey
Monks who practice the Way of the Tipsy Monkey lurch and waddle across the battlefield, seeming to be too intoxicated to comport themselves. Their school of fighting is typified by its low-standing stance, periods of swaying in place punctuated with bursts of wild, staggering movement, and the disorienting manner in which they seem to never be in the place they appear to be standing.

Despite the name of their style, monks of this Way often abstain from drinking alcohol, though they are not prohibited from doing so. Many do, however, display traits of their patron monkey in their love of jests and their easy laughter, even in the most fraught situations.

### Level 3: Adaptive Fighting
Monks of the Way of the Tipsy Monkey keep their foes off-balance by using unexpected things as weapons. Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you are proficient with improvised weapons, and you can treat them as Martial Arts. When you use a magic item as an improvised weapons, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls with that improvised weapons based on the magicitem's rarity: +1 for uncommon, +2 for rare, or +3 for very rare. At the GM's discretion, some magic items, such as rings or other magical jewelry, might not be viable as improvised weapons.

### Level 3: Sway and Strike
At 3rd level, your unpredictable movements let you take advantage of more openings. Once per round when an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can spend 1 Ki point to make an opportunity attack without spending your reaction. If this attack hits, you can force the target to roll a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it falls prone.

### Level 6: Jester Style
Beginning at 6th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to halve the damage that you take.

When you are prone, you don't have disadvantage on attack rolls, and enemies within 5 feet of you don't have advantage on attack rolls against you. You can stand up without spending movement anytime you spend Ki on your turn.

You have advantage on any ability check or saving throw you make to escape from a grapple. If you fail to escape a grapple, you can spend 1 Ki point to succeed instead.

### Level 11: Fortune Favors the Fool
Starting at 11th level, when you miss with an attack on your turn, the next attack you make that hits a target before the end of your turn deals an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. If you make that attack using an improvised weapons, it deals an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon's type instead.

### Level 17: Stumbling Stance
 At 17th level, your staggering movements make you dangerous at a distance and make it difficult for foes to safely move away from you. If your speed is not 0, your reach is extended by 5 feet, and you have advantage on opportunity attack.</description>

    <description>Way of the Unerring Arrow (ToH)

### Level 3: Way of the Unerring Arrow
The inner peace of contemplation, the artistry of focused breathing, and the calm awareness which leads to pinpoint accuracy all contribute to the Way of the Unerring Arrow. Some are dedicated soldiers, others walk the path of a wandering warrior-mendicant, but all of them hone their art of self-control, spirituality, and the martial arts, combining unarmed combat with archery. Select this tradition if you want to play a character who is as comfortable trading kicks and blows as they are with snatching an arrow from the air and firing it back in a single motion.

### Level 3: Archery Training
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your particular martial arts training guides you to master the use of bows. The shortbow and longbow are Martial Arts for you. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with shortbows or longbows.

When you make an unarmed strike as a bonus action as part of your Martial Arts feature or as part of a Flurry of Blows, you can choose for the unarmed strike to deal piercing damage as you jab the target with an arrow.

### Level 3: Flurry of Deflection
At 3rd level, you get additional reactions equal to your proficiency bonus, but these reactions can be used only for your Deflect Missiles monk class feature. If you reduce the damage of the ranged weapon attack to 0 and the missile can be fired with a shortbow or longbow, you can spend 1 Ki point to make a ranged attack with your shortbow or longbow, using the missile you caught as ammunition.

At 9th level, when you use Deflect Missiles, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 2d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

### Level 6: Needle Eye of Insight
At 6th level, your attacks with shortbow and longbow count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, when you make a ranged attack with a shortbow or longbow, you can spend 1 Ki point to cause your ranged attacks to ignore Cover until the start of your next turn.

### Level 11: Steel Rain Blossom
At 11th level, you can fire arrows in a deadly rain. While wielding a shortbow or longbow, you can use an action to fire an arcing arrow at a point you can see within your weapon's normal range. As the arrow descends onto the point, it magically replicates into dozens of arrows. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take piercing damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die. A creature behind Cover automatically succeeds on this saving throw. You can increase the steel rain's damage by spending Ki points. Each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by one Martial Arts die.

In addition, when you would make an unarmed strike as a bonus action as part of your Martial Arts feature or as part of a Flurry of Blows, you can choose to make a ranged attack with a shortbow or longbow instead.

### Level 17: Improbable Shot
At 17th level, when you use your Needle Eye of Insight feature to ignore Cover, you can spend 3 Ki points to ignore all forms of Cover instead. The arrow even passes through solid barriers, provided you have seen the target within the past minute and it is within your weapon's normal range.

Alternatively, you can spend 5 Ki points to strike a target you have seen within the past minute that is now on a different plane or in an extradimensional space, such as through the plane shift or rope trick spells or a phase spider's Ethereal Jaunt trait. If you do so, you can't use this feature in this way again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>Way of the Wild Cat (ToH)

### Level 3: Way of the Wild Cat
Monks of the Wildcat train relentlessly to incorporate speed, acrobatics, and precision strikes to exert control over the field of battle and foes alike. They learn techniques that emulate the grace and agility of felines, including reflexively avoiding blows and bounding between opponents with ease. Embodying the Way of the Wildcat requires intense devotion, endless practice, and no small amount of daring.

### Level 3: Enhanced Agility
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill if you don't already have it. When you move at least 10 feet on your turn, you have advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) check you make before the start of your next turn.

### Level 3: Feline Reflexes
Also at 3rd level, the inner power infusing your reflexes augments your nimbleness and makes it harder to hit you. When a creature you can see misses you with an attack, the next attack against you before the start of your next turn is made with disadvantage. This can happen only once each turn. If you spend 2 Ki points when a creature you can see misses you with an attack, you can take the Dodge action as a reaction instead.

You can't benefit from this feature if your speed is 0.

### Level 6: Springing Pounce
Starting at 6th level, when you move at least 10 feet straight toward a creature and hit it with an attack on the same turn, you can spend 1 Ki point to channel your momentum into your attack, dealing extra damage or pushing the target (your choice). If dealing extra damage, the attack deals extra damage of the weapon's type equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier. If pushing the target, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you. If you used Step of the Wind to Dash before making the attack, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.

You can use this feature only once per turn.

### Level 11: Improved Feline Reflexes
Starting at 11th level, when you take no damage after succeeding on a Dexterity saving throw as a result of the Evasion monk class feature, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward the source of the effect, such as the dragon or spellcaster that exhaled the lightning or cast the fireball that you avoided. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the source, you can spend 3 Ki points to make one unarmed strike against it.

### Level 17: Hundred Step Strike
At 17th level, you can use your Springing Pounce feature as many times each turn as you want, provided you have the movement and attacks to do so. You must still spend 1 Ki point each time you channel your momentum into your attack. Each time you move after hitting a creature in this way, you don't provoke opportunity attack. If you miss an attack, further movement provokes opportunity attack as normal.

If you use Flurry of Blows with Springing Pounce and hit a different creature with each attack, you can make one additional Springing Pounce attack without spending Ki, provided you have the movement to do so.</description>

  <element name="Oath of Justice" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_paladin_Oath_of_Justice">
    <supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
    <description>Oath of Justice (ToH)

### Level 3: Oath of Justice
The Oath of Justice is a commitment not to the tenets of good or evil but a holy vow sworn to uphold the laws of a nation, a city, or even a tiny village. When lawlessness threatens the peace, those who swear to uphold the Oath of Justice intervene to maintain order, for if order falls to lawlessness, it is only a matter of time before all of civilization collapses into anarchy.

While many young paladins take this oath to protect their country and the people close to them from criminals, some older adherents to this oath know that what is just is not necessarily what is right.

### Level 3: Tenets of Justice
All paladins of justice uphold the law in some capacity, but their oath differs depending on their station. A paladin who serves a queen upholds slightly different tenets than one who serves a small town.

The law represents the triumph of civilization over the untamed wilds. It must be preserved at all costs.

The severity of justice acts in equal measure to the severity of a wrongdoer's transgressions.

### Level 3: Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Justice Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

### Level 3: Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

You can use your Channel Divinity to bind your target to you. As an action, you extend a line of energy toward a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is tethered and can't move more than 30 feet away from you for 1 minute. While tethered, the target takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) at the end of each of its turns. You can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by the tethered creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the creature's choice). On a success, you can pull the creature up to 15 feet in a straight line toward you. As an action, the tethered creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it breaks the tether.

You can use your Channel Divinity to respond to danger with lightning speed. When a creature that you can see is attacked, you can move up to your speed as a reaction. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the attacker, you can make one melee attack against it as part of this reaction. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the target of the attack, you can become the target of the attack instead as part of this reaction.

### Level 7: Disciplined Pursuant
At 7th level, you can bend the laws of magic to parallel the laws of civilization. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a spell or Divine Smite, you can choose to knock out the creature instead of killing it. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.In addition, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to a creature, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. If you deal radiant damage to more than one creature, you can choose only one creature to be affected by this feature.

### Level 15: Shackles of Light
Starting at 15th level, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to a creature, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is restrained by golden, spectral chains until the end of its next turn. If you deal radiant damage to more than one creature, you can choose only one such creature to be affected by this feature. The target of this feature can be different from the target of your Disciplined Pursuant feature.

### Level 20: Avatar of Perfect Order
At 20th level, you can take on the appearance of justice itself. As an action, you become wreathed in a garment of cold light. For 1 minute, you benefit from the following effects:

You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
You can use your Channel Divinity feature without expending a use of Channel Divinity.
When a creature you can see takes the Attack or Cast a Spell action, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must take a different action of your choice instead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
    <description>Oath of Safeguarding (ToH)

### Level 3: Oath of Safeguarding
Paladins who choose the Oath of Safeguarding spend their lives in service to others, conserving the people and places they vow to protect. They take missions to guard against assassination attempts, safely transport a person or group through treacherous lands, and stand as bastions for locations under attack. These paladins are no mere mercenaries, however, as they view their missions as sacred vows.

### Level 3: Tenets of Safeguarding
Paladins undertaking the Oath of Safeguarding take their responsibilities seriously and are most likely to seek atonement should they fail in their duties. However, they have no qualms about terminating their protection when their charges prove nefarious. In these cases, they won't leave people stranded in a hostile environment or situation, but they also focus their efforts on their allies over unworthy, former charges. Even when these paladins serve no charge, they seek opportunities to shield others from harm. In combat, they rush to aid their allies and stand alone to allow others to flee from battle.

When your allies must retreat or regroup, you remain to ensure they have ample time to withdraw before withdrawing yourself. If your mission requires you to guard a building, you are the final obstacle the attackers face before breaching the building.

You pledge to preserve the lives of people you protect and the sanctity of all structures you guard, even if it means endangering yourself. When you must rest, you ensure your charge is as safe as possible, turning to trusted allies to aid you.

In the absence of a sacred charge to protect, you endeavor to keep all those who can't defend themselves safe from harm. In cases where your charge must take priority, you do what you can to defend the helpless.

You acknowledge the person you protect may reveal themselves as unworthy, such as by committing nefarious acts or exploiting your protection and fidelity, or the location you guard may become a site of terrible acts. When you witness this, you are free to terminate your guardianship. However, you don't leave your now-former charge in any present danger, if only for the possibility of future atonement.

Nothing shall distract you from your mission. If you are magically compelled to desert your post, you do your utmost to resume your duty. Failing that, you take out your vengeance on the party responsible for your dereliction.

### Level 3: Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Safeguarding Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

### Level 3: Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and stamp one foot on the ground. The ground within 60 feet of you magically becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. When you use this feature, you can designate up to 10 creatures that can ignore the difficult terrain.

As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak reassuring words. For 1 minute, each friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you has advantage on saving throws against spells and abilities that deal damage. In addition, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

### Level 7: Aura of Preservation
Beginning at 7th level, you emit an aura of safety while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction. The first time you or a friendly creature within the aura would take damage from a weapon attack between the end of your previous turn and the start of your next turn, the target of the attack has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, each friendly creature within the aura has advantage on death saving throws.

When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet, and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

### Level 15: Battlefield Controller
Starting at 15th level, you can't be shove. When a hostile creature within 10 feet of you moves more than 10 feet away from you, you can use your reaction to move up to 10 feet and make an attack against that creature.

### Level 20: Redoubtable Defender
At 20th level, as an action, you can touch your charge, typically a creature or structure, and create a magical link between you, which appears as a razor-thin, ghostly silver tether. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:

You know the general status and well-being of your charge, such as if your charge is wounded orexperiencing a particularly strong emotion, or, in the case of an object or structure, if it is damaged.
As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your charge, if it is a person or object. If the charge is a structure, you can choose to teleport to any unoccupied space within the structure.
You are immune to spells and effects that cause you to be charmed or might otherwise influence you to harm your charge.
If your charge is a creature and within 5 feet of you, the charge is immune to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it has advantage on all saving throws.
You can use an action to erect a barrier for 1 minute, similar to a wall of force, to protect your charge. The wall can be a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 5 feet, or four contiguous 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. If your charge is a structure, the barrier can cut through portions of the structure without harming it.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>Oath of the Elements (ToH)

### Level 3: Oath of the Elements
The Oath of the Elements is taken by those paladins who have dedicated their lives to serving the awakened spirits of air, earth, fire, and water. Such paladins might also serve a genie, elemental deity, or other powerful elemental creature.

### Level 3: Tenets of the Elements
Though exact interpretations and words of the Oath of the Elements vary between those who serve the subtle, elemental spirits of the world and those who serve elemental deities or genies, paladins of this oathshare these tenets.

Every mountaintop, valley, cave, stream, and spring is sacred. You would fight to your last breath to protect natural places from harm.

You stand at the forefront of every battle as a beacon of hope to lead your allies to victory.

You weigh your actions carefully and offer counsel to those who would behave impulsively. When the time is right, you unleash the fury of the elements upon your enemies.

Your word is your bond. You don't lie or deceive others and always treat them with fairness.

### Level 3: Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Elements Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

### Level 3: Elemental Language
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you learn to speak, read, and write Primordial.

### Level 3: Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

You can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke elementals and fiends. As an action, you present your holy symbol and recite ancient edicts from when the elements ruled the world. Each elemental or fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to magically imbue one weapon you are holding with the power of the elements. Choose air, earth, fire, or water. For 1 minute, you gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) on attacks made with the weapon. The type of damage is based on the element you chose: lightning or thunder (air), acid (earth), fire (fire), or cold (water). While your weapon is imbued with an element, you can choose to deal its damage type instead of radiant damage when you use your Divine Smite.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

### Level 7: Aura of Resistance
Beginning at 7th level, your power over the elements forms a magical ward around you. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage when you finish a resting. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage of this type. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Level 15: Elemental Companion
At 15th level, you can call upon the service of an elemental companion to aid you on your quests. As an action, you can summon an elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. The elemental is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys any verbal commands you issue to it. If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. It rolls its own initiative and has its own turns in combat.,

You can have only one elemental companion at a time. If you summon a new one, the previous one disappears. In addition, you can't have a creature magically bound to you or your service, such as through the conjure elemental or dominate person spells or similar magic, while you have an elemental companion, but you can still have the willing service of a creature that isn't magically bound to you.

The elemental continues to serve you until you dismiss it as a bonus action or it is reduced to 0 hit points, which causes it to disappear. Once you summon an elemental companion, you can't summon another one until you finish a resting.

### Level 20: Elemental Champion
At 20th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest the unchained power of the elements. Your eyes glow with fire, your hair and clothes move as if blown by a strong wind, droplets of rain float in a watery halo around you, and the ground trembles with your every step. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

You gain the Flying Movement of an air elemental (90 feet with hover), the Earth Glide trait and Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling of an earth elemental (30 feet), or the Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling of a water elemental (90 feet).
You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage.
Any weapon you hold is imbued with the power of the elements. Choose an element, as with Channel Divinity. Your weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage to any creature you hit. The type of damage is based on the element you chose: lightning or thunder (air), acid (earth), fire (fire), or cold (water). While your weapon is imbued with an element, you can choose to deal its damage type in place of radiant damage when you use your Divine Smite.

    <description>Oath of the Guardian (ToH)

### Level 3: Oath of the Guardian
A paladin who takes the Oath of the Guardian is sworn to defend the community. Taking the mantle of a guardian is a solemn vow to place the needs of the many before the needs of yourself and requires constant vigilance.

### Level 3: Tenets of the Guardian
When you take this oath, you always do so with a particular group, town, region, or government in mind, pledging to protect them.

You must work hard to bring joy and prosperity to all around you.

Order must be protected and preserved for all to enjoy. You must work to keep treasured people, objects, and communities safe.

Threats to peaceful life are often nefarious and subtle. The actions you take to combat such threats should not be.

### Level 3: Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Guardian Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

### Level 3: Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

You can use your Channel Divinity to inspire your allies with your faith. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). For 1 minute, each target has advantage on Strength, Constitution, and Charisma saving throws.

As an action, you can cause wild creatures to flee from your presence using your Channel Divinity. Each creature within 30 feet of you with an Intelligence score of 4 or less that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Level 7: Aura of Awareness
Starting at 7th level, allies around you are more alert and ready to act. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 10 feet of you can't be Surprise except when incapacitated. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Level 15: Hold the Line
At 15th level, you can turn an ally's success into an opportunity. When a friendly creature you can see within 20 feet of you is forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to the target's saving throw. If the saving throw is successful, the target can make one weapon attack against the attacker as a reaction, provided the attacker is within the weapon's range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 20: Band of Heroes
At 20th level, you can charge your allies with divine heroism. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to your proficiency bonus, which can include yourself. Each target gains the following benefits for 1 minute:

The target is cured of all disease and poison and can't be frightened or poisoned.
The target has advantage on Wisdom and Constitution saving throws.
The target gains temporary hit points equal to your level.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>Oath of the Hearth (ToH)

### Level 3: Oath of the Hearth
Paladins who swear the Oath of the Hearth endeavor to extend the comforts of home to others, by allaying the rigors of travel or simply assuring those who grow despondent of the possibility of returning home. Ironically, paladins who follow this oath remain far from home in pursuit of their goals. Their oath reflects the welcoming warmth and light provided by the hearth, and paladins following the oath use these elements to turn away the cold or defeat enemies who employ cold as weapons.

### Level 3: Tenets of the Hearth
Paladins who take the Oath of the Hearth accommodate all creatures and attempt to find diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Once engaged in battle, though, these paladins fight until they defeat their enemies, or their enemies surrender. They rarely extend this peaceful stance to creatures who attack with cold or desire to spread cold conditions beyond natural confines.

Reach out the hand of friendship when encountering strangers, and advocate for peace at the outset of any meeting. Encourage your companions to do likewise. When it becomes clear your opponents wish for violence, don't shrink away from combat.

When winter comes and the nights increasingly lengthen, shine a welcoming light to which all people can rally. No creature shall prey on others under the cover of darkness while you are there.

Provide the comforts of home to those who meet with you peacefully. Respect others' cultures and traditions, provided they don't espouse aggression and violence toward others.

Ensure all people have shelter from the weather. Help during spring flooding, wintry blizzards, and when the blistering sun threatens heatstroke in the summer.

Strive against foes that seek to bring eternal winter to the world or expand their icy domains into warmer climates. Understand the necessity of the changing of seasons and seek to banish only cold that is abnormal.

### Level 3: Divine Sense
In addition to knowing the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead, your Divine Sense feature allows you to know the location of any cold creature within 60 feet of you that is not behind Cover.

The oath of the hearth references "cold" creatures for some of its features. The most straightforward definition applies to creatures that deal cold damage with their attacks and other actions. However, this also could apply to creatures with vulnerability to fire damage, or resistance or immunity to cold damage, and creatures that use spells and other abilities that inflict cold damage or call forth non-damaging, wintry elements (such as the sleet storm spell).

### Level 3: Fiery Smite
When you use your Divine Smite feature, you can choose for the extra damage you deal to be fire or radiant, and the extra damage increases to 1d8 only if the target is an undead or a cold creature.

### Level 3: Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Hearth Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

### Level 3: Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak soothing words. For 1 minute, each creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to attack another creature. A creature hostile to you has disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect ends on a creature if it is attacked or harmed by a spell.

As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak a prayer against unnatural cold. Each cold creature within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Level 7: Aura of the Hearth
Beginning at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that deal cold damage. If such a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or effect that allows the creature to take only half the cold damage on a successful save, the creature instead takes no damage. In addition, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against the long-term effects of exposure to Extreme Cold. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Level 15: Icewalker
Starting at 15th level, you have resistance to cold damage, and you can't be restrained or petrified by cold or ice. In addition, you can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.

### Level 20: Roaring Fire
At 20th level, you can take on the aspects of a healthy, tended fire, radiating heat and light. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

You shed Vision and Light in a 20-foot radius and Vision and Light for an additional 20 feet.
Whenever a cold creature starts its turn within 20 feet of you, the creature takes 2d8 fire damage, which ignores resistance and immunity to fire damage.
Whenever you cast a paladin spell that deals fire damage and has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it as a bonus action instead.
Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. If you deal fire damage to a cold creature, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute, or until it takes any damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>Oath of the Plaguetouched (ToH)

### Level 3: Oath of the Plaguetouched
After suffering an attack by a darakhul, you were infected with the dreaded—and generally fatal—darakhul fever. As you felt your life draining away and the grasp of eternal undeath clenching its cold fingers around your heart, you called out to any power that would answer your prayers. You pledged that you would do anything asked of you, if only you would be spared this fate worse than death.

That prayer was answered. The source of that answered prayer is not known, but its power flowed through you, helping you drive off the horrible unlife that was your fate. That power flows through you still. It drives you to defend innocents from the scourge of undeath, and it provides special powers for you to use in that fight.

### Level 3: Restriction: Non-Darakhul
You can choose this paladin sacred oath only if you are not a darakhul.

### Level 3: Tenets of the Plaguetouched
Paladins following the Oath of the Plaguetouched share these tenets.

In the face of terrible creatures, you stand like a wall between them and the innocent people whom those creatures would devour or transform.

Fight to ensure the undead don't snuff out the light of life in the world.

Creatures of undeath never tire; you must remain vigilant.

Those who suffer disease must be cared for. If you could survive certain death, so can they. But when it is clear they are about to transform into a monster, you must end their suffering quickly.

### Level 3: Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Plaguetouched Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

### Level 3: Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

As a bonus action, you summon forth your power into a shining aura around yourself. For 1 minute, you shed Vision and Light in a 10-foot radius and Vision and Light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, each hostile creature within 5 feet of you has disadvantage on its first attack roll each turn that isn't against you. If the hostile creature is undead, it instead has disadvantage on all attack rolls that aren't against you. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and call upon your power, using your Channel Divinity. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Level 7: Aura of Radiant Energy
Beginning at 7th level, you and your allies within 10 feet of you have resistance to necrotic damage. In addition, when you or a friendly creature hit an undead creature within 10 feet of you with a melee weapon attack, the attacker can choose if the attack deals radiant damage or its normal type of damage At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Level 15: Bulwark Against Death and Disease
Starting at 15th level, you can expend only 1 hit point from your Lay on Hands pool to cure the target of a disease. In addition, your hit point maximum can't be reduced, and you have advantage on saving throws against effects from undead creatures that reduce your ability scores, such as a shadow's Strength Drain.

### Level 20: Scourge of Undeath
At 20th level, as a bonus action, you can become a scourge to undead. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

The bright light shed by your Channel Divinity is sunlight.
You have advantage on attack rolls against undead.
An undead creature in your Aura of Radiant Energy takes extra radiant damage equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) when you or a friendly creature hit it with a melee weapon attack.

    <description>Beast Trainer (ToH)

### Level 3: Beast Trainer
People have used animals in their war efforts since time immemorial. As a beast trainer, you teach animals how to fight and survive on the battlefield. You also train them to recognize and obey your allies when you aren't able to direct them. While a beast trainer can train any type of animal, they often generate a strong bond with one species and focus their training on beasts of that type.

### Level 3: Beast Whisperer
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Animal Handling. If you already have proficiency in this skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it.

### Level 3: Trained Animals
Beginning when you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a beast companion. Choose a beast that is Medium or smaller and has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. The beast is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys any commands that you issue to it. In combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. The beast can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics.

If you are knocked unconscious, killed, or otherwise unable to command your trained animal, one of your allies can use a bonus action to command it by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.

When you reach 7th level, you can have more than one trained animal at a time. All your trained animals can have a total challenge rating equal to a quarter of your level, rounded down. A beast with a challenge rating of 0 is considered to have a challenge rating of 1/8 for the purpose of determining the number of trained animals you can have. You can use a bonus action to direct all your trained animals to take the same action, or you can use an action to command all of them to take different actions.

To have one or more trained animals, you must spend at least one hour each day practicing commands and playing with your animals, which you can do during a resting.

If a trained animal dies, you can use an action to touch the animal and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The animal returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

### Level 7: Bestial Flanker
At 7th level, when you hit a creature, you can choose one of your trained animals you can see within 30 feet of you. If that trained animal attacks the creature you hit before your next turn, it has advantage on its first attack roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 11: Bred for Battle
Starting at 11th level, add half your proficiency bonus to each trained animal's AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and to any skills in which it is proficient, and increase each trained animal's hit point maximum by twice your proficiency bonus. In addition, you can choose Large and smaller beasts when you select trained animals.

### Level 15: Primal Whirlwind
At 15th level, when you command your trained animals to use the Attack action, you can choose for one trained animal to attack all creatures within 5 feet of it, making one attack against each creature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>Grove Warden (ToH)

### Level 3: Grove Warden
Fiercely protective of their territory, alseid herds form close bonds with their home forests. In return for their diligent protection, the forests offer their blessings to dedicated alseid rangers. In recent years, woodsy adventurers of other races who have earned the forests' trust also received this blessing, though their numbers are scant. These Grove Wardens can tap into the living magic of ancient forests. Your senses travel through the plants and earth of the woods, and the very land rises up to strike down your enemies.

### Level 3: Grove Warden Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Grove Warden Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Level 3: Whispers of the Forest
At 3rd level, when you use your Primeval Awareness feature while within a forest, you add humanoids to the list of creature types you can sense. When sensing humanoids, you know the general direction of the creatures, and you know if a humanoid is solitary, in a small group of up to 5 humanoids, or a pack of more than 5 humanoids.

### Level 3: Forest's Will
At 3rd level, you can magically draw on the living essence of the land to hamper your foes. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Your next weapon attack against that creature has advantage. If that attack hits, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 11th level in this class, if that attack hits, the creature's speed is instead halved until the start of your next turn.

### Level 7: Intruder's Bane
At 7th level, you can command the land around you to come to your aid. As a bonus action, choose a point you can see on the ground within 60 feet. You cause the area within 15 feet of that point to undulate and warp. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature is pushed up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice and knocked prone. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or resting.

### Level 11: Wrath of the Forest
At 11th level, you can call on the land in your vicinity to strike at your enemies. When you take the Attack action, you can use a bonus action to make a rock, branch, root, or other small natural object attack a creature within 30 feet of you. You are proficient with the attack, it counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and you add your Dexterity modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is of a type appropriate to the object, such as piercing for a thorny branch or bludgeoning for a rock, and the damage die is a d8.

### Level 15: Living Bulwark
Starting at 15th level, the land around you comes to your aid when you are in danger, interposing rocks, branches, vines, roots, or even the ground itself between you and your foes. When a creature you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to roll a d8 and add it to your AC against the attack.</description>

    <description>Gunslinger (ToH)

### Level 3: Gunslinger
Gunslingers use their expertise to hunt and track for coin, using their marksmanship skills to bring down their prey. Some gunslingers work by a personal code that defines what they will or will not do for money, while others have no scruples in who or what they hunt.

### Level 3: Gunslinger Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Gunslinger Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Level 3: Trick Shot
You can use your firearms to pull off special feats of marksmanship. Trick shots provide special effects or secondary functions to your firearm attacks. Unless otherwise stated, you can use a trick shot as part of the same action you use to attack with the firearm. You can use only one trick shot each turn. If you are wielding a blunderbuss, you can use only the Deafening Blast and Haft Strike trick shots.

If a trick shot requires a saving throw against its effects, the DC equals:

Some trick shots reference weapon options, which can be found in the Adventuring Rules chapter of this book.

As your bullet flies toward your target, you can cause one creature you can see within 5 feet of the path of the shot to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is deafened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

You can use the Disarm weapon option when attacking with a firearm. If the target is beyond the normal range for the weapon, it has advantage on its saving throw. Use your trick shot DC for this saving throw instead of the weapon option DC.

As a bonus action after you load your firearm, you can whip the weapon around and use the stock to make a melee attack at a target within 5 feet of you. This attack deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage if done with a one-handed firearm, or 1d8 bludgeoning damage with a two-handed firearm, plus your Strength modifier.

You can use the Ricochet Shot weapon option against a target that has Cover, provided you are aware of which space the target occupies.

You can fire a round from your gun to manipulate an object at a distance, up to the maximum range of your firearm. This allows you to take the Use an Object action from a distance, though your action is limited to things that can be done with the impact of the bullet, such as punching a button, moving a lever, severing a rope, or similar actions.

You can also use this trick shot to move an object weighing no more than 10 pounds, pushing it up to 5 feet away from its original location. If an object is being worn or carried, the creature wearing or carrying it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to prevent the object from being moved.

You fire a shot into a space occupied by a Large or smaller creature, near its feet or body. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be compelled to move 5 feet in a direction of your choosing. The creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it would be compelled to move into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit.

### Level 7: Defensive Tactics
At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

When you fail a death saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

You are immune to the deafened condition.

When a hostile creature you can see makes a ranged attack against you before your turn (including during the first round of combat), you can make a ranged attack against that enemy as a reaction.

When a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can move up to half your speed as a reaction after the damage is dealt. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack.

### Level 11: Improved Trick Shot
At 11th level, your impressive marksmanship allows you to perform even greater trick shots with more powerful effects. These improved trick shots require more focus, and you must use an action to perform an improved trick shot.

Make one ranged attack with your firearm. On a hit, if the target is concentration on a spell, the DC of the Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration is equal to 10 or the full damage taken, whichever is higher.

Make one ranged attack with your firearm. Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on this attack roll. On a hit, double your damage dice for the attack. If you are firing a blunderbuss, choose one target in range to take the extra damage, rolling normally for the rest.

Make one ranged attack with your firearm. On a hit, the target takes damage as normal and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

### Level 15: Deadeye
Beginning at 15th level, your weapon attacks with firearms score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</description>

### Level 3: Haunted Warden
Haunted Wardens use their expertise to hunt and track for coin, using their marksmanship skills to bring down their prey. Some gunslingers work by a personal code that defines what they will or will not do for money, while others have no scruples in who or what they hunt.

### Level 3: Beyond the Pale
Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to see into the Ethereal Plane for 1 minute. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 3: Haunted Warden Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Haunted Warden Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Level 3: Spirit Usher
At 3rd level, you gain an undead spirit that anchors itself to you and accompanies you on your journeys. The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See the spirit's game statistics in the Spirit Usher stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

You determine the spirit's appearance, name, and personality. You should choose a personality trait, ideal, bond, and flaw for it, and you should work with your GM to decide on a background story for the spirit that fits the campaign.

In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

When it joins with you, the spirit learns three cantrips it can cast at will, which you select from the following lists. At the end of a resting, you can change which cantrips the spirit knows.

Choose one of chill touch, ray of frost, sacred flame, or vicious mockery. Use your level when determining the damage of the chosen cantrip.
Choose one of druidcraft, prestidigitation, or thaumaturgy.
Choose one of dancing lights, message, or minor illusion.

The spirit is bonded to you. It can't be turned or destroyed, such as with the cleric's Channel Divinity: Turn Undead feature. When the spirit usher dies, it retreats to the Ethereal Plane to restore itself and returns to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you when you finish a resting. If the spirit usher died within the last hour, you can use your action to expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to return it to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

### Level 7: Merge Spirit
Starting at 7th level, you can use an action to cause your Spirit Usher to join its essence with you for 1 minute. While merged, you gain the spirit usher's Ethereal Sight trait and can interact with creatures and objects on both the Ethereal and Material Planes. In addition, while you are merged, you become less substantial and gain the spirit usher's damage resistances and damage immunities.

Once you use this feature, you shouldn't use it again until you finish a resting. Each time you use it again, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

### Level 11: Guardian Geist
At 11th level, when you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to call out to your Spirit Usher. If you do, your spirit usher teleports to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you and takes half the damage dealt to you, potentially preventing your death.

In addition, when your  spirit usher dies, you have advantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn.

### Level 15: True Psychopomp
At 15th level, you can use your Merge Spirit feature as a bonus action instead of an action. When you and your  spirit usher merge forms, you gain its ncorporeal Movement trait and Etherealness action, and you are considered to be undead for the purposes of determining whether or not spells or other magical effects can affect you.</description>

    <description>Snake Speaker (ToH)

### Level 3: Snake Speaker
Like the serpents they adore, snake speakers are highly adaptable hunters. Snakes are common throughout the world, and people who need to travel through snake-filled jungles often retain a snake speaker guide, trusting the guide to protect them from scaly poisoners.

### Level 3: Snake Speaker Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Snake Speaker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Level 3: Scaly Transition
Beginning at 3rd level, you can take on limited serpentine aspects. When you finish a resting, select one of the following features. You gain the benefit of the chosen feature until the next time you finish a resting. Starting at 11th level, you can select two options when you finish a resting.

You develop venomous fangs. When you use the Attack action and attack with a weapon, you can use a bonus action to bite a target within 5 feet of you with your fangs. You are proficient with the fangs, which deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) plus 1d8 poison damage on a hit.

Your nose and olfactory organs change to resemble those belonging to a snake. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on scent and on Wisdom (Insight) checks.

You have resistance to poison damage.

Scales sprout along your body. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

You have a Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling of 30 feet.

### Level 3: Speak with Snakes
Starting at 3rd level, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with snakes. A snake's knowledge and awareness are limited by its Intelligence, but it can give you information about things it has perceived within the last day. You can persuade a snake to perform small favors for you, such as carrying a written message to a nearby companion.

### Level 7: Serpent Shape
When you reach 7th level, you can use an action to cast polymorph on yourself, assuming the shape of a giant constrictor snake, flying snake, or giant poisonous snake. While you are in the form of a snake, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

Starting at 15th level, you retain the benefits of your Scaly Transition feature while in the form of a snake, and you can use this feature twice between rests.

### Level 11: Sinuous Dance
Beginning at 11th level, your physical movements can beguile your enemies and strengthen your magic. You can choose to use Dexterity as your spellcasting ability score instead of Wisdom.

In addition, when you cast a spell, you can add your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers together and use the result as your spellcasting ability modifier when determining the DC or spell attack bonus for that spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 15: Decoy Skin
Starting at 15th level, you learn to magically shed your skin and use it as an animate decoy. As an action, you can shed your skin, which creates a duplicate of yourself. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. It looks like you, has your Armor Class and saving throw bonuses, and has hit points equal to three times your ranger level. It lasts for 10 minutes or until it is reduced to 0 hit points.

As a bonus action, you can command it to move up to your speed, using any form of movement you possess, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. Your decoy can't take actions or use your class features, but it otherwise moves as directed. While your decoy is within 5 feet of you, its appearance and movements so closely mimic yours that when a creature that can reach you and your decoy makes an attack against you, it has a 50 percent change of hitting your decoy instead.

It looks exactly as you looked when you used this feature, and it is a convincing duplicate of you. A creature can discern that it isn't you with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>Spear of the Weald (ToH)

### Level 3: Spear of the Weald
The alseid have long defended the limits of their forest homes. These warriors can make a dizzying variety of ranged and melee attacks in quick succession, using ancient magic to flash across the battlefield.

### Level 3: Restriction: Alseid
You can choose this archetype only if you are an alseid.

### Level 3: Weald Spear
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to call forth a magical, wooden spear from the land of fey into your empty hand as a bonus action. The spear disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You are proficient with the weapon while you wield it. The spear's range is 20/60 feet, and, when you throw the spear, it reappears in your hand after the attack. The spear's damage die is a d8, and it has the finesse and reach properties.

At 7th level, your weald spear attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and your weald spear's damage die is a d10. At 11th level, your weald spear's damage die is a d12.

### Level 3: Touch of the Fey Land
The touch of the land of the fey is always on your spear, hinting at its otherworldly ties. Beginning at 3rd level, when you summon your Weald Spear, choose one of the following effects.

Your spear is ensorcelled in heatless, white, magical flames whose intensity rise and fall to reflect your mood. When you are at your happiest, your spear sheds Vision and Light in a 5-foot radius and Vision and Light for an additional 5 feet.

Your spear appears to be wrapped in writhing green vines which occasionally coalesce into the shape of a slender, grasping hand. The hand always points in the direction of your home forest.

Your spear is covered in small wildflowers that bloom, die, bud, and bloom again within minutes. Pollinating insects are often drawn to your spear as the spear constantly exudes a pleasant, floral fragrance.

Your spear appears as a pale length of wooden moonlight. A trail of star-like motes travels behind the spear's point.

### Level 7: Canopy
Beginning at 7th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you, including yourself, is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to summon a magical canopy of glowing leaves and branches over the target. The target has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack, and the canopy bursts into shredded leaves afterwards. You must then finish a resting to use your Canopy again.

When you reach 11th level in this class, you can use your Canopy twice between resting, and at 18th level, you can use it three times between resting. When you finish a resting, you regain all expended uses.

### Level 11: Steps of the Forest God
Starting at 11th level, after you make a successful ranged weapon attack with your Weald Spear, you can use a bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of your target.

### Level 15: Overwhelm
At 15th level, after you make a successful melee weapon attack with your Weald Spear against a creature, you can use a bonus action to make one ranged weapon attack with it against a different creature. You don't have disadvantage on the ranged attack roll from being within 5 feet of the first creature you hit, however, you can still have disadvantage on the attack roll from being within 5 feet of other creatures.</description>

    <description>Wasteland Strider (ToH)

### Level 3: Wasteland Strider
A barren landscape wracked by chaotic magics, crawling with strange monstrosities and twisted aberrations that warp the minds of those who lay eyes upon them ... you have learned to traverse these wastes and face these creatures without flinching. You patrol its boundaries and stride unseen through its harsh landscape, evading danger and protecting those who find themselves at the mercy of the arcana-laced wilds and eldritch horrors.

### Level 3: Chaotic Strikes
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you've learned to channel the unpredictable energies of magical wastelands into your weapon attacks. You can use a bonus action to imbue your weapon with chaotic energy for 1 minute. Roll a d8 and consult the Chaotic Strikes table to determine which type of energy is imbued in your weapon. While your weapon is imbued with chaotic energy, it deals an extra 1d4 damage of the imbued type to any target you hit with it. If you are no longer holding or carrying the weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

### Level 3: Wasteland Strider Magic
Also tarting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Wasteland Strider Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Level 7: Stalwart Psyche
Starting at 7th level, you have learned to guard your mind against the terrors of the unknown and to pierce the illusions of the otherworldly creatures that lurk in the wastelands. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened and on ability checks and saving throws to discern illusions.

### Level 11: Call the Otherworldly
At 11th level, you've gained some control over otherworldly beings. You can use an action to summon a fiend or aberration with a challenge rating of 2 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. It disappears after 1 hour, when you are incapacitated, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.

The otherworldly being is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the otherworldly being, it attacks the creature you are attacking, or defends itself from hostile creatures if you aren't attacking a creature, but otherwise takes no actions.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting. When you reach 17th level in this class, you can summon a fiend or aberration with a challenge rating of 5 or lower with this feature.

### Level 15: Dimensional Step
At 15th level, you have learned to slip briefly between worlds. You can cast the dimension door spell without expending a spell slot. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Cat Burglar" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_rogue_Cat_Burglar">
    <supports>Roguish Archetype</supports>
    <description>Cat Burglar (ToH)

### Level 3: Cat Burglar
As a cat burglar, you've honed your ability to enter closed or restricted areas, drawing upon a tradition first developed among the catfolk, who often are innately curious and driven to learn what wonders, riches, or unusual friends and foes lie beyond their reach or just out of sight. In ages past, some allowed this inquisitiveness to guide them toward a rogue's life devoted to bridging that gap by breaking into any and all structures, dungeons, or walled-off regions that prevented them from satisfying their curiosity.

So successful were these first catfolk burglars that other rogues soon began emulating their techniques. Walls become but minor inconveniences once you work out the best methods of scaling them and learn to mitigate injuries from falls. In time, cat burglars become adept at breaching any openings they find; after all, if a door was not meant to be opened, why would it have been placed there? Those who devote a lifetime to such endeavors eventually learn to spot and bypass even the cleverest traps and hidden doors, including those disguised or warded by magic.

Some cat burglars use their abilities to help themselves to the contents of treasure vaults or uncover hidden secrets, others become an integral part of an adventuring party that values skillful infiltration techniques, and still others get the jump on their foes by taking the fight to them where and when they least expect it, up to and including private bed chambers or inner sanctums. You'll likely end up someplace you're not supposed to be, but those are the places most worth visiting!

### Level 3: Up, Over, and In
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have a Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling equal to your walking speed. If you already have a Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling equal to or greater than your walking speed, it increases by 5 feet. In addition, when you are falling, you can use your reaction to soften the fall. You reduce the Falling you take by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus + your rogue level. You don't land prone, unless the damage you take from the fall would reduce you to less than half your hit point maximum.

### Level 3: Artful Dodger
At 3rd level, alert to the dangers posed by hidden traps and wards, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist a trap or a magic effect with a trigger, such as the glyph of warding spell, and you have resistance to the damage dealt by such effects.

### Level 9: Cat's Eye
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to find or disarm traps, locate secret or hidden doors, discern the existence of an illusion, or spot a glyph of warding. You can also search for traps while traveling at a Travel Pace, instead of only while at a Travel Pace.

### Level 13: Breaking and Entering
At 13th level, when you make an attack against a door, gate, window, shutters, bars, or similar object or structure that is blocking or barring an egress, you have advantage on the attack roll, and you can add your Sneak Attack damage on a hit. You can choose for this damage to be audible out to a range of 100 feet or to be audible only within 5 feet of the point where you hit the object or structure. Similarly, you can choose for this damage to appear more or less impactful than it actually is, such as neatly carving a hole for you to squeeze through a wall or window or bursting a door off its hinges.

Your expertise at deftly dismantling crafted works extends to constructs and undead. You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack feature against constructs and undead. As normal, you can't use Sneak Attack if you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Level 17: Master Burglar
At 17th level, you can slip past a fire-breathing statue unscathed or tread lightly enough to not set off a pressure plate. The first time on each of your turns that you would trigger a trap or magic effect with a trigger, such as the glyph of warding spell, you can choose to not trigger it.

As a bonus action, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus that you can see within 30 feet of you and grant them the effects of this feature for 1 hour. Once you grant this feature to others, you can't do so again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Dawn Blade" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_rogue_Dawn_Blade">
    <supports>Roguish Archetype</supports>
    <description>Dawn Blade (ToH)

### Level 3: Dawn Blade
Even churches and temples of deities of goodness and light have need of those willing to get their hands dirty and willing to sully their honor in service of what must be done. Dawn blades are devout rogues, drawing divine power from deities of light to strike as a sudden ray of searing sunlight in the darkness. They are often considered controversial by other adherents of their faith, yet the faith's leadership understands such agents are sometimes necessary.

### Level 3: Eyes of the Dawn
At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet.

### Level 3: Dawn Strike
Starting at 3rd level, when you deal damage with your Sneak Attack feature, you can magically change the extra damage dealt to radiant damage. When you hit an undead or a creature of shadow with such a Sneak Attack, you deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage.

### Level 3: Radiant Beam
Beginning at 3rd level, when you deal radiant damage to a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to throw a portion of that radiant energy at a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged weapon attack against the second creature. You are proficient with this beam, and you don't have disadvantage on the ranged attack roll from being within 5 feet of the first creature (though you can still have disadvantage from other sources). On a hit, the beam deals 1d6 radiant damage.

When you reach 10th level in this class, the beam's damage increases to 2d6.

### Level 9: Bolstering Light
Starting at 9th level, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with radiant damage, choose one of the following:

Gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rogue level for 1 hour.
End one condition affecting you. The condition can be blinded, deafened, or poisoned.
End one curse affecting you.
End one disease affecting you.

### Level 13: Sudden Illumination
At 13th level, when you hit a creature with your Radiant Beam, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

### Level 17: Dawn Flare
At 17th level, when you use your Dawn Strike feature to deal radiant damage to a creature that can't see you, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 radiant damage and can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Once a creature takes damage from this feature, it is immune to your Dawn Flare for 24 hours.</description>

  <element name="Sapper" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_rogue_Sapper">
    <supports>Roguish Archetype</supports>
    <description>Sapper (ToH)

### Level 3: Sapper
You focus as much on identifying the weak points of structures as on the weak points of creatures. Sappers are deployed with the soldiery to dig trenches, build bridges, and breach defenses. When troops move into a heavily defended area, it's your job to make it happen as efficiently as possible.

### Level 3: Combat Engineer
When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in alchemist's supplies, carpenter's tools, mason's tools, and tinker's tools. Using these tools, you can do or create the following.

As an action, you can mix together volatile chemicals into an explosive compound and throw it at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Alchemical bombs lose their potency and become inert 1 minute after they are created.

If a construct fails the saving throw or if you throw the bomb at a structure or an object that isn't being worn or carried, your bomb also deals your Sneak Attack damage to the target.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the bomb's damage increases: at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

You are adept at creating fortifications with whatever materials are at hand. With 1 minute of work, you can create one of the following. Your ability to use this option might be limited by the available building materials or if the ground is too hard to work, at the GM's discretion.

Create a low wall that is large enough to provide Cover to a Medium creature.
Dig a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide trench to a depth of 3 feet.
Build a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide ladder. Each additional minute spent on this option increases the length of the ladder by 5 feet. The ladder is sturdy enough to be used as a bridge.

You can create and set some types of traps quickly. The Creating Traps table indicates the timeframes required to build and deploycommonly used traps. At the GM's discretion, you can use this feature to make and use other types of traps.

### Level 3: Sculpt Terrain
At 3rd level, when you throw your Combat Engineer, you can choose for the bomb to not deal damage. If you do so, the area within 10 feet of the point of impact becomes difficult terrain. You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature, if the creature is within the difficult terrain created by your Combat Engineer.

### Level 9: Breach Defenses
Starting at 9th level, when you hit a structure or an object that isn't being worn or carried, your attack treats the structure or object as if its damage threshold is 5 lower. For example, if you hit a door that has a damage threshold of 10, its damage threshold is considered 5 when determining if your attack's damage meets or exceeds its threshold. If a structure or object doesn't have a damage threshold or if this feature would allow you to treat its damage threshold as 0 or lower, your attack also deals your Sneak Attack damage to the target.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage threshold your attacks can ignore increases: at 13th level (10) and 17th level (15).

### Level 13: Clear the Path
At 13th level, you have advantage on checks to disarm traps. If you fail a check made to disarm a trap, the trap doesn't trigger even if its description states otherwise. In addition, you can disarm a trap as a bonus action.

### Level 17: All Clear
Beginning at 17th level, you can use an action to declare a 50-foot-square area safe for travel for 1 minute. Mechanical and magical traps in the area don't trigger for the duration. In addition, difficult terrain in the area doesn't cost you or any creatures you designate who can see or hear you extra movement when moving through it. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <supports>Roguish Archetype</supports>
    <description>Smuggler (ToH)

### Level 3: Smuggler
The transport of goods, creatures, and even people can be a lucrative business, particularly if you know how to avoid expensive import and export taxes, bridge, highway, and port tolls, and other legal requirements. Exotic poisons from far-off locales, banned or cursed magic items, and illicit drugs or bootleg liquor all fetch a high price on the black market. Thieves' guilds, pirates, and criminal kingpins pay well to those who can avoid law enforcement when moving stolen goods, provide safe channels of communication, break associates free from jail cells or dungeons, or deliver supplies past guards. You've become adept at all of these things, perhaps even having developed a network of contacts as a criminal, noble, con artist, or sailor during an earlier part of your life.

### Level 3: Dab-handed Dealer
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with vehicles (land and water) and with your choice of either the disguise kit or navigator's tools. Moreover, when determining your carrying capacity, you are considered one size category larger than your actual size.

Starting at this level, you also have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to hide objects on vehicles, and you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a check to control a vehicle, or to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to conceal a light weapon on yourself, opposed by the Wisdom (Perception) checks of creatures within 5 feet of you; if you succeed on a check to conceal a weapon in this way, then you have advantage on your next attack against one of those creatures using that weapon, including on ranged attacks even if the target is within 5 feet of you.

### Level 3: Smuggler's Legerdemain
Also at 3rd level, having made a careful study of laws and those who enforce them, you've become adept at avoiding both, even mastering a handful of arcane techniques that aid your smuggling activities. You learn two cantrips at this level and, when you reach 7th level in this class, one 1st-level spell of your choice. The cantrips and spell must be from among the illusion or transmutation spells on the wizard spell list, all of which are ideally suited for manipulating goods, duping guards, communicating with covert contacts, or escaping from a failed heist. Having learned these forms of magic through research and rote memorization, Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

You can cast the cantrips at will and the spell once at its lowest level; you must finish a resting before casting the spell again in this way. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace the 1st-level spell with another 1st-level spell of your choice from among the illusion or transmutation spells on the wizard spell list.

### Level 9: Hypervigilance
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or hearing, and you can't be Surprise while you are conscious. In addition, you have developed an awareness for avoiding social or legal entrapment, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to discern loopholes and traps in legal documents and on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern when you are being manipulated into a bad social or legal situation.

### Level 13: Improved Smuggler's Legerdemain
At 13th level, to further facilitate your extralegal activities, you learn a second illusion or transmutation spell, which must be one of the following: Nystul's magic aura, blur, darkvision, enlarge/reduce, invisibility, knock, levitate, magic mouth, mirror image, rope trick, or spider climb. Intelligence is again your spellcasting ability for this spell. You can cast this spell once at its lowest level and must finish a resting before you can cast it again in this way. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd-level or higher. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace a spell from this list with another from this list.

In addition, beginning at 13th level, whenever you cast one of your 1st-level Smuggler's Legerdemain spells, you always cast it as if using a 2nd-level spell slot unless you choose to cast it using a spell slot you have of a different level.

### Level 17: Slippery as an Eel
Starting at 17th level, you have become especially adept at slipping away from the authorities and getting a jump on foes, even when encumbered by illicit goods. Your speed increases by 10 feet, you ignore difficult terrain, and you have advantage on initiative rolls.</description>

    <description>Soulspy (ToH)

### Level 3: Soulspy
In the eternal war between good and evil, between light and darkness, between life and death, there are many types of participants on each side. Soulspies are agents of the divine who lurk in the shadows, taking a less-visible role in the fight. Occasionally, they aid other agents of their deities, but most often they locate and manage or eliminate threats to their deities that more scrupulous agents might be unwilling or unable to handle.

### Level 3: Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells drawn from the magic of a divine entity.

### Level 3: Cantrips
You learn three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn another cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

### Level 3: Spell Slots
The Soulspy Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend one of these slots at the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a resting.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell inflict wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast inflict wounds using either slot.

### Level 3: Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level cleric spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and necromancy spells on the cleric spell list. The Spells Known column of the Soulspy Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or necromancy spell and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can be from any school of magic.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cleric spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or necromancy spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

### Level 3: Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You learn your spells through meditation and prayer to the powerful forces that guide your actions. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

### Level 3: Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Religion skill, if you don't already have it.

### Level 3: Divine Symbol
Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to create a symbol of your deity that hovers within 5 feet of you. The symbol is a Tiny object that is visible but invulnerable and intangible, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you dismiss it (no action required). While this symbol is active, you gain the following benefits:

Your Divine Symbol functions as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
As a bonus action, you can turn the symbol into thieves' tools, which you can use to pick locks, disarm traps, or any other activities that would normally require such tools. While your Divine Symbol is functioning in this way, it loses all other properties listed here. You can change it from thieves' tools back to its symbol form as a bonus action.
The symbol sheds Vision and Light in a 10-foot radius and Vision and Light for an additional 10 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action. When you extinguish the symbol's light, you can also snuff out one candle, torch, or other nonmagical light source within 10 feet of you.
When you create this symbol, and as an action on each of your turns while the symbol is active, you can force the symbol to shoot divine energy at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). When you reach certain levels in this class, the symbol's damage increases: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

### Level 9: Sacred Stealth
Starting at 9th level, you can use your Sneak Attack on a creature hit by an attack with your Divine Symbol if the target of the attack is within 5 feet of an ally, that ally isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 13: Touching the Soul
When you reach 13th level, you can use your Divine Symbol to deliver your cleric spells that have a range of touch. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you as the target of the spell. You can't use your Sacred Stealth feature on a spell delivered in this way. After you cast the spell, your Divine Symbol ends.

In addition, when you cast a spell that deals radiant or necrotic damage, you can switch it to do the other type of damage instead.

### Level 17: Life Thief
At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically channel life force energy out of one creature and into another. When you deal radiant or necrotic damage with your Divine Symbol attack or a cleric spell or cantrip, choose a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to half the radiant or necrotic damage dealt. You can target yourself with this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <description>Underfoot (ToH)

### Level 3: Underfoot
Though most rogues prefer ambushing their opponents from the shadows, erina rogues ambush their opponents from below. These Underfoot use druidic magic and their natural aptitude for burrowing to defend their forest homes. The Underfoot are an elite order of burrow warriors in every erina colony. Using a combination of guerilla attacks and druidic magic, they are a force to be reckoned with, diving into fights nose-forward.

### Level 3: Restriction: Erina
You can choose this roguish archetype only if you are an erina.

### Level 3: Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells drawn from the magic of the wilds.

### Level 3: Cantrips
You learn three cantrips: shillelagh and two other cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn another druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

### Level 3: Spell Slots
The Underfoot Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend one of these slots at the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a resting.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell longstrider and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast longstrider using either slot.

### Level 3: Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the divination and transmutation spells on the druid spell list. The Spells Known column of the Underfoot Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an divination or transmutation spell and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can be from any school of magic.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the druid spells you know and replace it with another spell from the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an divination or transmutation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

### Level 3: Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. Your magic draws upon your connection with the natural world. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

### Level 3: Versatile Shillelagh
Beginning at 3rd level, when you cast shillelagh, the spell is modified in the following ways:

Its duration increases to 1 hour.
The spell ends early only if another creature holds the weapon or if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more.
Your Sneak Attack feature can be applied to attack rolls made with your shillelagh weapon.

### Level 9: Undermine
Beginning at 9th level, you can use your action to dig a hole under a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If the target fails its saving throw, you can make one weapon attack against that target as a bonus action.

### Level 13: Death From Below
Beginning at 13th level, when you move at least 10 feet underground toward a target, your next attack against the target with your shillelagh weapon has advantage.

### Level 17: Vicious
At 17th level, when you use your Death From Below feature and hit the target with your shillelagh weapon, the target is restrained by vegetation and soil until the end of its next turn.</description>

    <supports>Sorcerous Origin</supports>
    <description>Black Powder Sorcery (ToH)

### Level 1: Black Powder Sorcery
Your innate magic comes from the explosive power of raw alchemy and black powder. You parents may have been alchemists, whose long exposure to alchemical reagents mingled with a latent talent for magic in their bloodlines and caused you to be born with such abilities. Or you may have been experimented upon—with or without your permission—when you were younger and those alchemical experiments brought this unexpected magical power to the surface. Whatever the catalyst for your powers, they bring with them an affinity for black powder, allowing you magical prowess that exploits its power to your benefit.

### Level 1: Gun Mage
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with simple firearms and with the musket (see the Adventuring Gear chapter for details on these weapons), and you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies or gunsmith's tools (your choice). In addition, you learn the mage hand cantrip if you don't already know it.

### Level 1: Gun Hand
Starting at 1st level, when you cast mage hand, you can perform the following additional tasks with it:

You can use your mage hand to draw or stow a pistol on your person or pick up a firearm within 5 feet of you that isn't being worn or carried. You can do this once on each of your turns for free, during either your move or your action.
You can use a bonus action to reload a pistol held by your mage hand. Your mage hand visibly becomes a pair of spectral hands to complete this action, the second hand vanishing once the pistol is loaded.
When a creature within 5 feet of you attacks you with a melee weapon, you can use a reaction to fire a pistol held by your mage hand at the attacker. Being within 5 feet of the target doesn't impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

You can create multiple mage hand with this feature when you reach higher levels. You gain a second mage hand at 5th level, and an additional mage hand at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Unlike your primary mage hand, these additional mage hand can be used only for the tasks described under this feature and any other aspects of this class that reference this feature. Each extra mage hand remains within 5 feet of you and vanishes if it is unable to remain within 5 feet of you.

### Level 1: Fusillade
Also at 1st level, when you use the Attack action, you can make the attack with a weapon you are wielding or with a pistol held in one of your mage hand. When you attack with a pistol held in one of your mage hand, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

In addition, when you reach 2nd level, you can use an action and spend 1 or more sorcery points to magically reload and fire a pistol held in one of your mage hand. The ammunition fired is magically created and dissipates after being fired, hit or miss. For each sorcery points you spend, you can magically reload and fire another pistol held in another of your mage hand as part of the same action. These attacks have a range of 30 feet. Attacks from your mage hand-held pistol can attack separate targets or the same target, dealing damage, including the possibility of a Gunpowder Burst, as normal on a hit. Each mage hand's attack counts as a separate attack for the purposes of determining the number of bursts that can happen. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 6: Magic Bullets
Beginning at 6th level, your attacks with firearms count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, when you make an attack with a firearm, you can spend 1 sorcery points to imbue the attack with elemental energy. Choose one of the following: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. On a hit, an imbued attack deals an extra 2d6 damage of the chosen type. At 14th level, you can spend 2 sorcery points instead, increasing the damage to 4d6.

### Level 14: Absorb Power
At 14th level, you can replenish your sorcerous power by absorbing the latent energy of black powder. In a ritual that takes 1 minute, you can absorb the power in up to 30 cartridges' worth of black powder (equivalent to a full gunpowder horn). For every 10 cartridges worth of gunpowder, you regain 1 expended sorcery points. The black powder is consumed in the process. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 18: Ensuing Shot
At 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell using a spell slot of 4th level or lower, you can make one attack with a pistol as a bonus action. This pistol can be held by you or by one of your mage hand. If you spend 6 sorcery points, you can make one attack with each pistol held by you and your mage hand instead.</description>

    <supports>Sorcerous Origin</supports>
    <description>Cold-Blooded (ToH)

### Level 1: Cold-Blooded
The serpentfolk slithered across the surface of the world in the primordial times before the warm-blooded races became dominant. They worked their will upon the land and ocean and created works to show their mastery of the magical arts. Their artistry did not end with the landscape. They also experimented on any warm-blooded creatures they captured until they had warped and molded the creatures into new and deadly forms.

One or more of your ancestors was experimented on or an associate of the world's earliest serpentfolk. Your ancestor's natural affinity for magic was nurtured, expanded, and warped by the experimentation of their ophidian masters in order to transform them into something closer to the serpentine ideal. Those alterations made so long ago have waxed in you, allowing you to influence intelligent creatures more easily. Now you must decide if you will follow the serpent's path of dominance and subjugation or if you will fight against their influence and use your power for a greater purpose.

### Level 1: Ophidian Metabolism
At 1st level, your affinity with serpents grants you a measure of their hardiness. You can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) + your proficiency bonus before you suffer the effects of food and water. You also have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.

### Level 1: Patterned Scales
Also at 1st level, when you use magic to trick or deceive, the residual energy of your spell subtly alters how others perceive you. When you cast an illusion spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the duration of the spell and for 10 minutes after the spell's duration ends.

### Level 6: Insinuating Serpent
Starting at 6th level, even when a creature resists your unsettling allure, your presence gets under their skin. When you cast an enchantment or illusion spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, and your target succeeds on its saving throw against your spell, your target becomes charmed by you until the start of your next turn. If the spell you cast affects multiple targets, only one of those targets can be affected by this feature.

### Level 14: Spirit Venom
At 14th level, you sap the will and resolve of creatures that are under your sway. If you start your turn with at least one creature within 30 feet of you that is currently charmed, frightened, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned by a spell you cast or a magical effect you created, such as from a magic item, you can use your reaction to force each such creature to take 6d4 psychic damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting. If you have expended all your uses of this feature, you can spend 5 sorcery points at the start of your turn to use it again.

### Level 18: Mirrored Lamina
Starting at 18th level, when you fail a saving throw against being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned by a spell or other magical effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature that cast the spell or created the magical effect to succeed on a saving throw against your spell save DC or suffer the same condition for the same duration.

If both you and the creature that targeted you are affected by a condition as a result of this feature and that condition allows for subsequent saving throws to end the effect, the condition ends for both of you if either one of you succeeds on a subsequent saving throw.</description>

  <element name="Hungering" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_sorcerer_Hungering">
    <supports>Sorcerous Origin</supports>
    <description>Hungering (ToH)

### Level 1: Hungering
Your innate magic comes from a deep, primal source of hunger and craving. Perhaps your line was cursed for its greed by a god of plenty or generosity. Perhaps one of your forebears was marked by the hungering undead. Sorcerers with this origin have an unyielding appetite for arcana and go to nearly any length to satiate their desire to increase their magical power.

### Level 1: Hungry Eyes
At 1st level, you can sense when a creature is nearing death. You know if a creature you can see that isn't undead or a construct within 30 feet of you is below half its hit point maximum. Your spell attacks ignore Cover when targeting creatures you sense with this feature.

### Level 1: Thirsty Soul
Beginning at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). This feature can restore you to no more than half your hit point maximum.

### Level 6: Feast of Arcana
Starting at 6th level, when you reduce one or more hostile creatures to 0 hit points with one spell of 1st level or higher, you regain 1 spent sorcery points.

### Level 14: Glutton for Punishment
Starting at 14th level, you can use your reaction to intentionally fail a saving throw against a spell that deals damage and that was cast by a hostile creature. If you do so, you regain a number of spent sorcery points equal to half your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

### Level 18: Greedy Heart
At 18th level, when you spend sorcery points to create spell slots or use metamagic, you reduce the cost by 1 sorcery points (this can't reduce the cost below 1).</description>

  <element name="Resonant Body" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_sorcerer_Resonant_Body">
    <supports>Sorcerous Origin</supports>
    <description>Resonant Body (ToH)

### Level 1: Resonant Body
You are a conduit for the power that exists in sounds and vibrations, your body a living tuning fork capable of emitting, focusing, muting, and transmuting sound and sonic forms of magic. Perhaps you endured overexposure to transmutation magic, arcane thunder, or the ear-splitting cries of an androsphinx, bukavac (see Tome of Beasts), or avalanche screamer (see Tome of Beasts 2). Maybe you can trace your lineage to an ancestor who spent an extended period on a plane dominated by elemental lightning and thunder or by unceasing screams of madness; you yourself may have been born on such a cacophonous plane. Alternately, you or a forebear may have suffered prolonged exposure to the deafening thunderclaps of a bronze dragon's lair. Or you may even have been experimented on by aboleths or other maniacal spellcasters, escaping before the transformation was complete....

Whatever its source, resonant magic infuses your very existence, causing you to manifest one or more unusual characteristics. At your option, you can create a quirk or roll a d6 and consult the Resonant Body Quirks table to determine a quirk for your character.

### Level 1: Signature Sound
At 1st level, you harbor sonic vibrations within you. You are immune to the deafened condition, and you have tremorsense out to a range of 10 feet. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that deal thunder damage.

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you have resistance to thunder damage, and at 6th level, your tremorsense extends to 20 feet.

### Level 1: Reverberating Quintessence
Starting at 1st level, you can cast the alarm spell (audible option only) once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you cast alarm in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a resting.

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you can expend 3 sorcery points to cast the shatter or silence spell without expending a spell slot or requiring material components.

### Level 6: Sonic Savant
Beginning at 6th level, whenever you use a Metamagic option on a spell that deals thunder damage, deafens creatures, or silences or magnifies sounds, you expend only a fraction of your effort to do so. With these sorts of spells, Metamagic options that normally cost only 1 sorcery points instead cost 0 sorcery points; all other Metamagic options cost half the normal number of sorcery points (rounded up).

You can use your Sonic Savant feature to reduce the cost of a number of Metamagic options equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Sound and Fury
At 14th level, your resistance to thunder damage becomes immunity. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can change the damage type to thunder. If the spell also imposes a condition on a creature damaged by the spell, you can choose to impose the deafened condition instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 18: Resounding Spellcasting
Beginning when you reach 18th level, any of your cantrips that deal thunder damage affect even those creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a cantripthat deals thunder damage, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

Moreover, you can increase the power of some of your spells. When you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st through 5th level that deals thunder damage, you can cause the spell to maximize its damage dice. Once you use this feature, you shouldn't use it again until you finish a resting. Each time you use it again, you take 2d12 force damage for each level of the spell you cast. This force damage ignores any resistance or immunity to force damage you might have.</description>

    <supports>Sorcerous Origin</supports>
    <description>Rifthopper (ToH)

### Level 1: Rifthopper
Rifthoppers are the living embodiment of wanderlust. The yearn to travel and witness unseen vistas burns in them and manifests in their ability to move nearly at the speed of thought. The origin of the rifthoppers' powers remains a mystery, as they refuse to stay in one place long enough to be studied extensively. Given the lack of empirical evidence, many scholars have hypothesized that rifthoppers absorb energy from the world itself, typically through an innate connection with ley lines or with areas where the borders between planes are thin, and can use it to alter their own magic.

Adventuring rifthoppers often concern themselves with investigating mysterious portals to unknown locations, researching ley lines and other mystic phenomena, or seeking out and stopping spatial and temporal disturbances.

### Level 1: Teleport Object
Starting at 1st level, you can use an action to teleport a small object that isn't being worn or carried and that you can see within 30 feet of you into your hand. Alternatively, you can teleport an object from your hand to a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The object can weigh no more than 5 pounds and must be able to fit into a 1-foot cube.

The weight of the object you can teleport increases when you reach certain levels in this class: at 6th (10 pounds), 14th level (15 pounds), and 18th level (20 pounds).

### Level 1: Shift Space
At 1st level, once on each of your turns, you can spend an amount of movement equal to up to half your speed and teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within a number of feet equal to the movement you spent. If your speed is 0, such as from being grappled or restrained, you can't use this feature.

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you can spend movement equal to your full speed, reducing your speed to 0 for the turn, and expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to teleport yourself to a destination within range. The range you can travel is dependent on the level of the spell slot expended as detailed in the Rifthopper Teleportation Distance table. You bring any objects you are wearing or carrying with you when you teleport, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your carrying capacity. If you teleport into an occupied space, you take 4d6 force damage and are pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.

### Level 6: Tactical Swap
At 6th level, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you starts its turn or when you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is attacked, you can use your reaction to swap positions with the creature. The target must be willing.

If you use this feature when you or another creature is attacked, the attack's target becomes the creature that now occupies the space being attacked, not the original target.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Familiar Locations
Starting at 14th level, if you spend an hour in a location, familiarizing yourself with its features and noting its peculiarities, you can use an action to teleport yourself and a number of willing creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you and that you can see to the location. You can teleport to this location over any distance as long as both you and it are on the same plane of existence. If the location is mobile, such as a boat or wagon, you can't familiarize yourself with it enough to use this feature.

You can be familiar with a number of locations equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You can choose to forget a location (no action required) to make room for familiarizing yourself with a new location.

You can teleport creatures with this feature a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 18: Dimensional Ambler
Starting at 18th level, you can use an action to transport yourself and a number of willing creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you and that you can see to the Astral Plane or to the Ethereal Plane. While you are on these planes, you and the creatures you transported can move normally, but each transported creature must stay within 60 feet of you. You can choose to return all of you to the Material Plane at any time as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Spore Sorcery" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_sorcerer_Spore_Sorcery">
    <supports>Sorcerous Origin</supports>
    <description>Spore Sorcery (ToH)

### Level 1: Spore Sorcery
One of the most omnipresent elements in the atmosphere is practically invisible and often ignored: spores. Plants of all varieties, fungal sentient life forms like mushroomfolk, and even animals emit these tiny pieces of life. You've always had an affinity for the natural world, and your innate magic is carried within the power of these omnipresent spores.

Spore sorcerers are regularly found among the mushroomfolk and derro who grow large gardens of fungi deep beneath the surface of the world. Spore sorcerers can also be found in any area with an abundance of plant life, such as forests, swamps, and deep jungles.

### Level 1: Nature Magic
Your affinity with the natural world and the spores that exist between all plants and creatures allows you to learn spells from the druid class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the druid spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.

In addition, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can cast speak with plants without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 1: Spore Transmission
At 1st level, your spores allow you to communicate with creatures telepathically. You can use a bonus action to create a telepathic link with one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the link ends, you can telepathically speak to the target, and, if it understands at least one language, it can speak telepathically to you. The link lasts for 10 minutes or until you use another bonus action to break the link or to establish this link with a different creature.

If the target is unwilling, it can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the link on a success. If an unwilling target ends the link in this way, you can't establish a link with that target again for 24 hours.

### Level 6: Metamagic Spore Transmission
Starting at 6th level, the spores connecting you and the target of your Spore Transmission enhance your metamagic effects on the linked target. You gain the following benefits when using the indicated Metamagic options:

If the spell allows a target to take only half damage on a successful saving throw, the linked target instead takes no damage.

When you use this Metamagic option to increase the range of a touch spell, the spell's range is 60 feet when cast on the linked target.

If cast on the linked target, the spell's duration is tripled rather than doubled, to a maximum of 36 hours.

If the linked target is reduced to 0 hit points with your hungry spell, you regain hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2).

If the linked target failed its saving throw against your lingering spell, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid the additional damage at the start of your next turn.

If you use this Metamagic option on the linked target, you and the target regain hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) if the target hits with its weapon attack.

By spending 1 additional sorcery point, you can affect the linked target in addition to the two original targets.

### Level 14: Spore's Protection
Starting at 14th level, when an attacker you can see targets you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to call forth spores to cloud its senses. The attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, you gain 10 temporary hit points as the spores bind the wound for a short time. The temporary hit points last for 1 minute.

### Level 18: Spore Form
At 18th level, you gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. In addition, as an action, you can radiate spores in a 20-foot radius around you for 1 minute. Each friendly creature that starts its turn in the area regains hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1). Each hostile creature that starts its turn in the area takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1). The target of your Spore Transmission regains (if it is friendly) or takes (if it is hostile) double this amount. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Wastelander" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_sorcerer_Wastelander">
    <supports>Sorcerous Origin</supports>
    <description>Wastelander (ToH)

### Level 1: Wastelander
Eldritch power and residual magical energy left over from a horrific arcane war is drawn to you as a lodestone is drawn to iron. Perhaps this attraction is due to a pact one of your ancestors made with an ancient eldritch horror. Perhaps it is an unfortunate twist of circumstance. Regardless, your physiology is in a constant state of transformation as a result of your condition. Some sorcerers who arise from magical wastelands embrace their body's modifications, others take to adventuring to find a cure for what they see as their affliction, while others still seek to make a mark on the world before oblivion claims them.

### Level 1: Alien Alteration
At 1st level, the influence of raw magical energy in your bloodline remodeled your form. You choose one of the following features as the alteration from your ancestry.

Your cranium is larger than most creatures of your type and houses your enlarged brain, which is partitioned in a manner that allows you to work on simultaneous tasks. You can use the Search action or make an Intelligence or Wisdom check as a bonus action on your turn.

Your legs are similar to the rear legs of a wolf or horse. Your movement speed increases by 10 feet, and you can stand up from prone by spending 5 feet of movement rather than half your speed.

You can use an action to transform one of your arms into a grotesque tentacle. The tentacle is a natural melee weapon with the reach property, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and the tentacle deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. At the start of your turn, if you are grapple a creature with the tentacle, you can deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage to it. You don't have fine motor control over your tentacle, and you can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of spells. You can revert your tentacle back into an arm as a bonus action.

You have a prehensile tail, which allows you to take the Use an Object action as a bonus action on your turn. Your tail can't wield weapons or shields, but it is capable of some manual precision, allowing you to use your tail to hold material components or perform the somatic components of spells. In addition, you can interact with up to two objects for free during your movement and action, provided you use your tail to interact with one of the objects.

### Level 1: Aberrant Physiology
Starting at 1st level, when a creature scores a critical hit on you, you can use your reaction to shift the positions of your vital organs and turn the critical hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by critical hit are canceled.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 6: Advanced Transformation
At 6th level, your increase in power also increases the concentration of raw magical energy in your blood, further altering your body. The alteration you chose from your Alien Alteration feature evolves as described below. Alternatively, you can choose a second option from the Alien Alteration feature instead of evolving the alteration you chose.

Your tentacle excretes acidic mucus. You can use a bonus action to suppress the mucus until the start of your next turn. While the tentacle excretes acidic mucus, it deals an extra 2d6 acid damage to any target it hits. A creature that is grappled by your tentacle at the start of your turn takes the extra acid damage when it takes the bludgeoning damage.

Your cranium expands even further as your brain swells in size. When you use your action to cast a spell, you can use a bonus action to make one melee or ranged weapon attack against a target in range.

Your legs elongate and your body sheds some of its weight to allow you to reach greater speeds. You can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each of your turns. When you Dash, the extra movement you gain is double your speed instead of equal to your speed.

Your tail extends to a length of 15 feet and the end splits into five finger-like appendages. You can do anything with your tail you could do with a hand, such as wield a weapon. In addition, you can use your tail to drink a potion as a bonus action.

### Level 14: Absorb Arcana
Starting at 14th level, when you succeed on a saving throw against a spell that would deal damage to you, you can use your reaction and spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to reduce the damage to 0.

### Level 18: Spontaneous Transformation
At 18th level, your body becomes more mutable. You can use a bonus action to gain a second option from the Alien Alteration feature and its evolved form from the Advanced Transformation feature for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <supports>Otherworldly Patron</supports>
    <description>Ancient Dragons (ToH)

### Level 1: Ancient Dragons
You have made a pact with one or more ancient dragons or a dragon god. You wield a measure of their control over the elements and have insight into their deep mysteries. As your power and connection to your patron or patrons grows, you take on more draconic features, even sprouting scales and wings.

### Level 1: Expanded Spell List
The Great Dragons allows you to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

### Level 1: Dragon Tongue
Starting at 1st level, you can speak, read, and write Draconic.

### Level 1: Wyrmling Blessing
Also starting at 1st level, your connection to your draconic patron or patrons bestows a blessing upon you. When you finish a resting, you choose which blessing to accept. You can have only one blessing at a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a resting.

You gain a Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. In addition, you can communicate with beasts that can breathe water as if you had cast the speak with animals spell.

When you are below half your hit point maximum and you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. This feature can restore you to no more than half of your hit point maximum.

You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this blessing increases its range by 30 feet. In addition, you can use an action to create an invisible sensor within 30 feet of you in a location you can see or in an obvious location within range, such as behind a door or around a corner, for 1 minute. The sensor is an extension of your own senses, allowing you to see and hear through it as if you were in its place, but you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses while using this sensor. As a bonus action, you can move the sensor anywhere within 30 feet of you. The sensor can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, and if it ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can use an action to end the sensor early.

A creature that can see the sensor, such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight, ees a luminous, intangible dragon's eye about the size of your fist.

Choose one of the following when you accept this blessing: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You can't change the type until you finish a resting and choose this blessing again. When you deal damage with a spell, you can choose for the spell's damage to be of the chosen type instead of its normal damage type.

### Level 6: Draconic Mien
At 6th level, you begin to take on draconic aspects. When you finish a resting, choose one of the following types of damage: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You have resistance to the chosen damage type. This resistance lasts until you finish a resting.

In addition, as an action, you can harness a portion of your patrons' mighty presence, causing a spectral version of your dragon patron's visage to appear over your head. Choose up to three creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed or frightened (your choice) until the end of your next turn. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a short or a resting.

### Level 10: Ascended Blessing
At 10th level, your connection to your draconic patron or patrons grows stronger, granting you morepowerful blessings. When you finish a resting, you choose which ascended blessing to accept. While you have an ascended blessing, you receive the benefits of its associated Wyrmling Blessing in addition to any new features of the ascended blessing. You can have only one blessing active at a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a resting.

While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Aquatic Affinity Wyrmling Blessing. You can cast the control water and dominate beast spells without expending spell slots. When you cast the dominate beast spell, you can target only beasts that can breathe water. You can cast each spell once in this way and regain the ability to do so when you finish a resting.

While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Draconic Hunger Wyrmling Blessing. When you kill a creature, you can crystallize a portion of its essence to create an essence gem. This gem functions as an ioun sotne, protection, but it works only for you and has no value. As a bonus action, you can destroy the gem to regain one expended spell slot. You can have only one essence gem at a time. If you create a new essence gem while you already have an essence gem, the previous gem crumbles to dust and is destroyed. Once you create an essence gem, you can't do so again until you finish a resting.

While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Draconic Sight Wyrmling Blessing. You have blindsight out to a range of 15 feet, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Elemental Versatility Wyrmling Blessing. When you cast a spell that deals damage of the chosen type, including a spell you changed using Elemental Versatility, you add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of the spell. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to deal damage of the chosen type equal to your proficiency bonus to the attacker. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Draconic Manifestation
At 14th level, you can assume the form of a dragon. As an action, you can transform into a dragon with a challenge rating as high as your warlock level divided by 3, rounded down, for 1 minute. This transformation works like the polymorph spell, except you can take only the form of a dragon, and you don't need to maintain concentration to maintain the transformation. While you are in the form of a dragon, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. For the purpose of this feature, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles, drakes, and wyverns. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Animal Lords" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_warlock_Animal_Lords">
    <supports>Otherworldly Patron</supports>
    <description>Animal Lords (ToH)

### Level 1: Animal Lords
While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in the fey courts and the Upper Planes. These timeless entities are connected to every animal of the kind they represent, and their primary concerns are for the well-being of these animals and the natural world as a whole.

Your patron is one such animal lord. Animal lords are varied in their motivations and often come into conflict with each other. They each command legions of animal followers and gather information from all of them. Unlike many other patrons, animal lords often have close relationships with those they bind with pacts, some to control, others to guide and advise. You are your animal lord's hand in the affairs of humanoids, and your allies are as numerous as the spiders in the corner or the birds in the sky.

You choose a specific animal lord to be your patron using the Animal Lord table. Each type of animal in the world can potentially have an animal lord. If you want to follow a specific type of animal lord, work with your GM to determine the animal lord's affinity and beast type and where that animal lord fits in the world. For a deeper dive on specific animal lords and for their game statistics, see Creature Codex and Tome of Beasts 2. These books aren't required to choose an animal lord as your patron or to play this class option.

### Level 1: Expanded Spell List
Animal Lords let you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The Animal Lord Expanded Spells table shows the animal lord spells that are added to the warlock spell list for you, along with the spells associated with your patron's affinity: air, earth, or water.

### Level 1: Natural Blessing
Starting at 1st level, you learn the druidcraft cantrip, and you gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill.

### Level 1: Animalistic Insight
At 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to discern your foe's flaws to aid in its downfall. You can use an action to analyze one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and impart this information to your companions. You and a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus each gain one of the following benefits (your choice). This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until the analyzed creature dies.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the analyzed creature.
You gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll when you hit the analyzed creature with an attack.
You have advantage on saving throws against the spells and effects of the analyzed creature.
When the analyzed creature attacks you, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting. When you reach 10th level in this class, each +1 bonus increases to +2.

### Level 6: Patron Companion
At 6th level, your patron sends you a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. The companion acts as the animal lord's eyes and ears, allowing your patron to watch over you, and, at times, advise, warn, or otherwise communicate with you.

Choose a beast that relates to your patron (as shown in the Beast Type column in the Animal Lords table) that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. If you have the Pact of the Chain Pact Boon, this beast becomes your familiar.

Your patron companion is friendly to you and your companions, and you can speak with it as if you shared a language. It obeys your commands and, in combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. Your patron companion can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use a bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If your companion dies, your patron sends a new one to you after 24 hours. If your patron companions die too often, your patron might be reluctant to send a new one or might reprimand you in other ways.

### Level 10: Primal Mastery
At 10th level, you can use your bond to your patron to tap into the innate connection between all animals. At the end of each resting, choose one of the following benefits. The benefit lasts until you finish a resting.

You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

You grow fangs. The fangs are a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with your fangs, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and your fangs deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

You can hold your breath for 10 minutes.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

Your jump distance is doubled.

You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.

Your speed increases by 10 feet.

You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

You have a Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling of 20 feet.

### Level 14: Call the Legions
At 14th level, you can summon a horde of beasts to come to your aid. As an action, you call upon your animal lord, and several beasts of your patron's type appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 60 feet of you. This works like a 7th-level conjure animals spell, except you don't need to maintain concentration. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Hunter in Darkness" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_warlock_Hunter_in_Darkness">
    <supports>Otherworldly Patron</supports>
    <description>Hunter in Darkness (ToH)

### Level 1: Hunter in Darkness
The Hunter in Darkness is an entity that sees all creatures as prey and enjoys instilling fear in its prey. It prefers intelligent prey over mere beasts, as their fear tastes so much sweeter. Hunters who display impressive prowess for hunting pique its interest. The Hunter in Darkness often bestows its power on such individuals to spread fear further than the Hunter can by itself.

Though your patron isn't mindless, it cares only for the thrill of the hunt and the spreading of fear. It cares not what you do with the power it grants you beyond that. Your connection with the Hunter can sometimes cause changes in your worldview. You might view every creature you meet as either predator or prey, or you might face problems with a "kill or be killed" attitude.

### Level 1: Expanded Spell List
The Hunter in Darkness lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

### Level 1: Savage Hunter
Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hp, its nearest ally within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.

### Level 3: The Hunter in Darkness and Your Pact Boons
When you select your pact boon at 3rd level, it is altered by your patron in the following ways.

Your familiar is a hunting hound made of shadow, and it uses the statistics of a wolf.

Your pact weapon can be a longbow or shortbow in addition to a melee weapon. You must provide arrows for the weapon.

Your tome contains descriptions of tracks made by a multitude of creatures. If you consult your tome for 1 minute while inspecting tracks, you can identify the type of creature that left the tracks (such as a winter wolf), though not the creature's name or specific appearance (such as Frosttooth, the one-eyed leader of a notorious pack of winter wolves that terrorizes the area).

### Level 6: Step Into Shadow
Beginning at 6th level, you can disappear into darkness and reappear next to an enemy. As a bonus action while in Vision and Light, you can disappear in a puff of inky smoke and reappear in an unoccupied space that is also in Vision and Light within 5 feet of a creature within 30 feet of you. If that creature is frightened and you attack it, you have advantage on the attack roll. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Strike from the Dark
Beginning at 10th level, your patron's constant hunger for fear inures you to it. You are immune to being frightened. In addition, when you are in Vision and Light and you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

### Level 14: Avatar of Death
Starting at 14th level, if you reduce a target to 0 hp with a weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to force each ally of the target within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. If a creature is immune to being frightened, it is instead stunned until the end of its next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Old Wood" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_warlock_Old_Wood">
    <supports>Otherworldly Patron</supports>
    <description>Old Wood (ToH)

### Level 1: Old Wood
You have made a pact with the ancient intelligence of a primeval forest. Before the rise of human civilization, before the time of the elves, before even the dragons, there were the forests. Empires rise and fall around them, but the forests remain as a testament to nature's endurance.

However, times are changing, and the unchecked growth of civilization threatens the green. The intelligences that imbue the antediluvian forests seek emissaries in the world that can act beyond their boughs, and one has heard your call for power. You are a guardian of the Old Wood, a questing branch issuing from a vast, slumbering intelligence sent to act on its behalf, perhaps even to excise these lesser beings from its borders.

### Level 1: Expanded Spell List
Your connection to the forest allows you to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

### Level 1: Sap Magic
At 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to absorb magic from nearby spellcasting. When a creature casts a spell of a level you can cast or lower within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to.

### Level 1: Forest's Defender
At 1st level, your patron gifts you with the skills necessary to defend it. You gain proficiency with shield, and you learn the shillelagh cantrip. Shillelagh counts as a warlock cantrip for you, but it doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

### Level 3: The Old Wood and Your Pact Boons
When you select your pact boon at 3rd level, it is altered by your patron in the following ways.

When you conjure your familiar or change its form, you can choose the form of an awakened shrub or child of the briar (see Tome of Beasts) in addition to the usual familiar choices.

The blade of the Old Wood is a weapon made of wood and thorns and grows out of your palm. When you cast shillelagh, your Pact Blade is affected by the spell, regardless of the form your Pact Blade takes.

The Old Wood grows a tome for you. The tome's cover is hardened bark from the forest's native trees, and its pages are leaves whose color changes with the seasons. If you want to add a new spell to your book, you must first plant it in the ground. After 1 hour, the book emerges from the soil with the new spell inscribed on its leaves. If your tome is lost or destroyed, you must return to your patron forest for it to grow you a new one.

### Level 6: Predatory Grace
Starting at 6th level, you are able to cast pass without trace without expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting. In addition, difficult terrain caused by roots, underbrush, and other natural forest terrain costs you no extra movement. You can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

### Level 10: Nature's Endurance
At 10th level, your patron has suffused your body with a portion of its ability to withstand harmful magic. You gain resistance to damage from spells of a level you can cast or lower.

### Level 14: Avatar of the Wood
Starting at 14th level, you can channel the power of the forest to physically transform, taking on many of its aspects. Your legs, arms, and torso elongate, your body becomes covered in thick, dark bark, and branches sprout from your head as your hair recedes. You can transform as a bonus action and the transformation lasts 1 minute. While transformed, you gain the following benefits:

Your Armor Class is 16 plus your Dexterity modifier.
You gain tremorsense with a radius of 30 feet, and your attacks can reach 5 feet further.
Your hands become branch-like claws, and you can use the Attack action to attack with the claws. You are proficient with the claws, and the claws count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You add your Charisma modifier to your attack and damage rolls with the claws. The damage is slashing and the damage die is a d6. If you have the pact boon feature, your claw attack benefits from your invocations as if it was a pact weapon.
Your Sap Magic feature changes to Arcasynthesis: When a spell of 5th level or lower is cast within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to synthesize the magic. The spell resolves as normal, but you have a 50 percent chance of regaining 1d10 hp per level of the spell cast.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Primordial" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_warlock_Primordial">
    <supports>Otherworldly Patron</supports>
    <description>Primordial (ToH)

### Level 1: Primordial
Some who search for power settle on lesser gods or demon lords, others delve into deeper mysteries until they touch elder entities. These great entities build worlds, crafting mountains and species as if sculpting clay, or annihilate them utterly. Embodying creation, destruction, and the land itself, your patron is an ancient power beyond mortal understanding.

Primordials stand in opposition to the Great Old Ones, the other side of the scale that maintains the balance of reality. Your primordial patron speaks to you in the language of omens, dreams, or intuition, and may call upon you to defend the natural world, to root out the forces of the Void, or even to manipulate seemingly random people or locations for reasons known only to their unfathomable purpose. While you can't grasp the full measure of your patron's designs, as long as your bond is strong, there is nothing that can stand in your way.

### Level 1: Expanded Spell List
The Primordial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

### Level 1: Convulsion of the Worldbuilder
At 1st level, you can use an action to call upon the bond between your primordial patron and the world it created to ripple shockwaves through the ground. Choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you, then choose if the ripples happen in a 30-foot cone, a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide, or a 20-foot-radius burst. The ripples originate from or are centered on the point you chose, depending on the form the ripples take. Each creature in the cone, line, or burst must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. If the ground in the area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting. When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage increases: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

### Level 6: Redirection
At 6th level, you learn to channel the reality-bending powers of your patron to avoid attacks. When a creature you can see attacks only you, you can use your reaction to redirect the attack to a target of your choice within range of the attacker's weapon or spell. If no other target is within range, you can't redirect the attack.

If the attack is from a spell of 4th level or higher, you must succeed on an ability check using your spellcasting ability to redirect it. The DC equals

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Adaptive Shroud
At 10th level, your bond with your patron protects you by adapting itself when you are injured. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. If you expend a spell slot as part of this reaction, the resistance lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Crushing Regard of the Primordial One
At 14th level, you learn to direct the weight of your patron's infinite gaze onto the unworthy. You can use an action to cause of the following effects. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

One creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d10 force damage and is paralyzed for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, a paralyzed target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the condition ends on the target.

Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 100 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.</description>

  <element name="Wyrdweaver" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_warlock_Wyrdweaver">
    <supports>Otherworldly Patron</supports>
    <description>Wyrdweaver (ToH)

### Level 1: Wyrdweaver
Your patron is probability itself, the personified wellspring of chance as embodied by chosen deities, entities, and eldritch beings across the planes. By binding yourself to the Wyrdweaver, you live by the roll of the dice and the flip of the coin, delighting in the randomness of life and the thrill of new experiences. You might find yourself driven to invade a lich's keep to ask it about its favorite song, or you might leap onto a dragon's back to have the right to call yourself a dragonrider. Life with a pact-bond to your patron might not be long, but it will be exciting.

### Level 1: Expanded Spell List
The Wyrdweaver lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

### Level 1: Probability Wellspring
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate probability. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel your patron abilities. The number of probability dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.

You can use these dice to turn the odds in your or your ally's favor. When you or a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend probability dice from the pool, rolling the dice and adding the total result to that roll. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a resting.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your probability dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

### Level 1: Appropriate Advantage
At 1st level, you learn to shift the weaves of fate to aid allies and hinder foes. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to expend one Probability Wellspring and force that creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, adding the Probability Wellspring to the DC. On a failed save, the creature loses advantage on that roll, and one friendly creature you can see within 60 feet has advantage on its next d20 roll of the same type the creature used (attack roll, ability check, or saving throw).

### Level 6: Improbable Duplicate
At 6th level, you can channel dark power from your patron to empower your attacks and spells. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one or more Probability Wellspring, up to half your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), and add the Probability Wellspring to the attack's damage roll.

### Level 10: Inconceivable Channeling
At 10th level, you learn to redirect magical energy, converting the power to restore your pool of Probability Wellspring. When a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to take the damage instead. You halve the damage you take as your Probability Wellspring absorbs some of the magical energy. For every 10 damage prevented in this way, you regain one expended Probability Wellspring. You can't regain more than half your maximum Probability Wellspring from this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

### Level 14: Favored Soul
Starting at 14th level, your very presence spins probability. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on that roll, and you have advantage on one d20 roll of your choice within the next minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Cantrip Adept" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_wizard_Cantrip_Adept">
    <supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
    <description>Cantrip Adept (ToH)

### Level 2: Cantrip Adept
It's easy to dismiss the humble cantrip as nothing more than an unsophisticated spell practiced by hedge wizards that proper mages need not focus on. But clever and cautious wizards sometimes specialize in such spells because while other mages fret when they're depleted of arcane resources, Cantrip Adepts hardly even notice ... and at their command, the cantrips are not so humble.

### Level 2: Cantrip Polymath
At 2nd level, you gain two cantrips of your choice from any spell list. For you, these cantrips count as wizard cantrips and don't count against the number of cantrips you know. In addition, any cantrip you learn or can cast from any other source, such as from a racial trait or feat, counts as a wizard cantrip for you.

### Level 2: Arcane Alacrity
Also at 2nd level, whenever you cast a wizard cantrip that has a casting time of an action, you can change the casting time to a bonus action for that casting. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a resting.

When you reach 10th level in this class, you regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a resting.

### Level 6: Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 6th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard cantrip you can cast.

### Level 10: Adroit Caster
Starting at 10th level, if you cast a cantrip that doesn't deal damage or a cantrip that has an effect in addition to damage, such as the speed reduction of the ray of frost spell, that cantrip or effect has twice the normal duration.

### Level 14: Empowered Cantrips
Starting at 14th level, once per turn, when you cast a wizard cantrip that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a resting.</description>

  <element name="Courser Mage" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_wizard_Courser_Mage">
    <supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
    <description>Courser Mage (ToH)

### Level 2: Courser Mage
A tradition more focused on stalking prey than reading dozens of books, courser mages generally choose more subtle spells that aid in finding or hiding from their enemies. They learn to imbue their arrows with spell energy to deliver more deadly shots.

### Level 2: Stalking Savant
At 2nd level, you gain proficiency with longbow and shortbow, and you gain proficiency in the Stealth skill. In addition, you can still perform the somatic components of wizard spells even when you have a longbow or shortbow in one or both hands.

### Level 2: Unseen Assailant
Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can choose a target you can see within 60 feet of you and become invisible to that target until the start of your next turn. Once the effect ends, you can't use this feature on that target again until you finish a resting.

### Level 6: Spell Arrow
Beginning at 6th level, you can imbue an arrow you fire from a longbow or shortbow with magical energy. As a bonus action, you can expend a 1st-level spell slot to cause the next arrow you fire to magically deal an extra 2d4 force damage to the target on a hit. If you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

### Level 10: Pinpoint Weakness
At 10th level, when you hit a creature with an arrow imbued by your Spell Arrow feature, your next ranged weapon attack against that creature has advantage.

### Level 14: Multitudinous Arrows
Starting at 14th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action with a longbow or shortbow on your turn. If you use your Spell Arrow feature, you can imbue both arrows witharcane power by expending one spell slot. If you imbue two arrows with this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.</description>

  <element name="Familiar Master" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_wizard_Familiar_Master">
    <supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
    <description>Familiar Master (ToH)

### Level 2: Familiar Master
Each wizard has a strong connection with their familiar, but some mages eschew specializing in a school of magic in favor of forming a powerful bond with a familiar. This bond allows the two to work in tandem in ways that few arcane practitioners could even dream of. Those who encounter such a familiar never look at a rodent or bird the same way again.

### Level 2: Familiar Savant
Beginning when you select this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you learn the find familiar spell if you don't know it already. You innately know this spell and don't need to have it scribed in your spellbook or prepared in order to cast it. When you cast find familiar, the casting time is 1 action, and it requires no material components.

You can cast find familiar without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

In addition, when you cast the find familiar spell, you can choose for your familiar to take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1/4 or lower, such as a flying snake, giant moth (see Creature Codex), or giant armadillo (see Tome of Beasts 2). The familiar has the statistics of the chosen beast form, but it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

When you reach 6th level in this class, your familiar can take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1 or lower. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, your familiar can be any Tiny celestial, dragon, fey, or fiend that is CR 1 or lower.

### Level 2: Greater Familiar
Also at 2nd level, when you cast find familiar, your familiar gains the following additional benefits:

Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, and it uses your proficiency bonus in place of its own when making ability checks and saving throws. It is proficient in any saving throw in which you are proficient.
Your familiar's hit points equal its normal hit point maximum or 1 + your Intelligence modifier + three times your wizard level, whichever is higher. It has a number of Hit Dice (d4s) equal to your wizard level.
In combat, your familiar shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take any action in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the familiar can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
Your familiar's attacks are enhanced by the magic bond you share with it. When making attack rolls, your familiar uses your spell attack bonus or its normal attack bonus, whichever is higher. In addition, when your familiar hits with an attack, the attack deals force damage equal to 1d4 + its Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus instead of its normal damage. If the familiar's attack normally deals additional damage, such as a flying snake's poison, or has an additional effect, such as an octopus's grapple, the familiar's attack still has that additional damage or effect.
Your familiar's Intelligence increases to 8 unless it is already higher. It can understand and speak Common and either Celestial (if celestial), Sylvan (if fey), or Abyssal or Infernal (if fiend).

### Level 6: Strengthened Bond
Starting at 6th level, your magical bond with your familiar grows stronger. If your familiar has a trait or action that forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. In addition, you can access your familiar's senses by using either an action or a bonus action, and whenever your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can expend its reaction to deliver any wizard spell you cast. If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more, you must be sharing your familiar's senses before casting the spell. If the spell requires an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you use your own statistics to adjudicate the result.

### Level 10: Arcane Amplification
Starting at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard spell you cast through your familiar. In addition, your familiar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Level 14: Companion Concentration
Starting at 14th level, when you are concentrating on a spell of 3rd level or lower, you can use an action to draw on your connection with your familiar to pass the burden of concentration onto it, freeing you up to concentrate on a different spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.</description>

    <supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
    <description>Gravebinding (ToH)

### Level 2: Gravebinding
While most wizards who desire power over the dead focus their efforts on necromancy, there are other, rarer, paths one can choose. Gravebinders focus their efforts on safeguarding tombs and graveyards to ensure the dead remain at rest and the living remain safe from the dead. When undead rise to prey upon the living, a gravebinder hunts downs the abominations and returns them to their eternal slumber.

### Level 2: Restriction: The Dead Must Rest
When you choose this wizard arcane tradition, you can no longer cast spells that animate, conjure, or create undead, and, if any such spells are copied in your spellbook, they fade from the book within 24 hours, leaving blank pages where the spells were.

### Level 2: Gravebinder Lore
At 2nd level, you can use an action to inscribe a small rune on a corpse. While this rune remains, the corpse can't become undead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

In addition, you have proficiency in the Religion skill if you don't already have it, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks made to recall lore about deities of death, burial practices, and the afterlife.

### Level 2: Hunter of the Dead
Starting at 2nd level, you gain access to spells passed down by generations of gravebinders. The heart to heart (2nd), dead walking (3rd), gird the spirit (3rd), life from death (5th), and lay to rest (9th) spells are wizard spells for you, and you add them to your spellbook at the indicated wizard levels (see the Magic and Spells chapter for details on these spells). Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

Also at 2nd level, you can use your action and expend one wizard spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether undead are present within 1 mile of you. You know the general direction of the undead creatures, though not their exact locations or numbers, and you know the direction of the most powerful undead within range.

### Level 6: Ward Against the Risen
Starting at 6th level, when an undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you targets an ally with an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to hamper the attack or spell. The undead has disadvantage on its attack roll or your ally has advantage on its saving throw against the undead's spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Disruptive Touch
Beginning at 10th level, when an undead creature takes damage from a 1st-level or higher spell you cast, it takes an extra 4d6 radiant damage. Undead creatures you kill using this feature are destroyed in a puff of golden motes.

### Level 14: Radiant Nimbus
At 14th level, you can use your action to envelope yourself in a shroud of golden flames for 1 minute. While enveloped, you gain the following benefits:

When you summon the flames and as an action on each of your turns while the flames are active, you can frighten undead within 30 feet of you. Each undead creature in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the flames fade or until it takes damage. An undead creature with sunlight sensitivity (or hypersensitivity, in the case of vampires) also takes 4d6 radiant damage if it fails the saving throw.
You shed Vision and Light in a 30-foot radius and Vision and Light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
When an undead creature hits you with a melee weapon attack, it takes 2d10 radiant damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.</description>

    <supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
    <description>School of Black Powder (ToH)

### Level 2: School of Black Powder
The school of black powder bridges magic and technology. Wizards of this school form a magical bond with a firearm, allowing them to channel their magic through the weapon to enhance its effects. Students go beyond simple offensive magics, using their black powder magic to great utility in aiding allies and hindering foes. Practitioners of this school refer to themselves as powdermancers, though manyfolk refer to all spellcasters with an affinity for firearms as "gun mages," not fully understanding firearms or the differences between the various magical disciplines and styles that utilize them.

### Level 2: Gun Savant
When you select this school at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with simple firearms and with the musket (see the Adventuring Gear chapter for details on these weapons). When attacking with firearms, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. You can use a firearm as a spellcasting focus. In addition, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies or gunsmith's tools (your choice).

### Level 2: Arcane Arms
Starting at 2nd level, you can imbue your firearm with arcane power to create minor magical effects. As an action, you can invoke one of the following effects, provided you have a gun in your hand. The effects created by this feature don't cause the firearm to release an audible boom, but other attacks or effects from your firearm still create the sound. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

You shoot a 15-foot cone of magical dust from the barrel of your firearm. Each creature or object in the area that is currently being affected by a spell, such as mage armor, or that is magical, such as bracers of archery, glows until the end of your next turn, shedding Vision and Light in a 5-foot radius.

You fire a bright ball of magical light from the barrel of your firearm. If fired into the air, the ball rises to a maximum height of 100 feet, unless stopped by an intervening obstacle, hovers until the end of your next turn, then falls slowly, reaching the ground by the end of the next round. The light extinguishes when it hits the ground. The flare can be seen up to 1 mile away in daylight or up to 5 miles in darkness. Alternatively, the flare can be fired up to 50 feet away in any other direction. Each creature within 5 feet of the path of the flare must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight for 1 minute.

You fire a magical shot from your firearm at a lock within the weapon's normal range. Make an attack roll with the firearm. If the result is equal to or exceeds the DC required to pick the lock, your shot destroys the lock. You have advantage on this attack roll if the lock is protected by magic, such as the arcane lock spell.

A cloud of smoke billows from your firearm, creating a 10-foot-radius sphere of smoke centered on you. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is Vision and Light. The cloud lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. When you reach 6th level, the sphere's radius increases to 20 feet.

You discharge your firearm into the air. Each friendly creature of your choice within 30 feet of you has its speed increased by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level, each affected creature can also Dash as a bonus action on its turn.

You fire a ball of light at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack with your firearm. On a hit, the attack deals damage as normal, and the target is outlined in light, as if affected by the faerie fire spell, until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level, the target is outlined in light for 1 minute.

### Level 6: Spell Shot
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that requires a melee spell attack roll, you can instead project the spell through your firearm, using the firearm's normal range as the range of the spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

In addition, your attacks with a firearm count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Level 10: Improved Arcane Arms
At 10th level, you are able to imbue your firearm with more powerful magical effects. When you use your Arcane Arms feature, you can choose one of the following effects instead. In addition, you can expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to regain a number of expended uses of your Arcane Arms feature equal to half the level of the spell slot.

You fire an illusionary shot at a target within 30 feet, your weapon booming and smoking as if you had actually made an attack. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is paralyzed with fear until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target is frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

You discharge your firearm into the air, dispersing a magical dust that settles around you. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet of you, including yourself, gains 2d4 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

As a bonus action, you can fire a crackling bolt of energy from your firearm at a friendly creature you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is suffering from exhaustion, its level of exhaustion is reduced by 1. If not, the target gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour and has advantage on its next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

You fire a shot into the air, producing a magically enhanced, thunderous boom. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you becomes indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if an affected target is attacked, is harmed by a spell, witnesses any of its allies being harmed, or if you use your firearm to invoke another Arcane Arms effect before the duration ends.

### Level 14: Hand Cannon
At 14th level, when you make a ranged attack roll with a firearm, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to imbue the firearm with great arcane power. If you do, you gain a bonus on the attack roll equal to the spell's level. If you hit the target, the force of the shot continues in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide directly away from you and originating from the target. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.

On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 force damage for each slot level of the spell expended. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage can experience Gunpowder Burst, as described in the gunpowder weapon property, but this effect counts as a single effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can Gunpowder Burst, regardless of the number of targets affected.</description>

  <element name="School of Liminality" type="Archetype" source="ToH" id="ID_ToH_ARCH_wizard_School_of_Liminality">
    <supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
    <description>School of Liminality (ToH)

### Level 2: School of Liminality
Liminal spaces are spaces on the boundary, at the edge between what's real and what's unreal. A liminal space can be neither here nor there, and yet be both here and there at the same time. Stories of liminal spaces are common across cultures, though their true nature often isn't recognized by the uninitiated: the stranger who appears suddenly at a lonely crossroads, the troll that snatches at unwary travelers from a hiding spot beneath a bridge where no such hiding spot exists, the strangely familiar yet unsettlingly different scene that's sometimes glimpsed in a looking glass.

These are only the most obvious encounters with liminal spaces! Most liminalities are more easily overlooked, being as unconscious as the heartbeat between waking and sleeping, as fleeting as drawing in breath as an apprentice and exhaling it as a master, or as unassumingly familiar—and as fraught with potential—as a doorway that's crossed a hundred times without incident.

Those who specialize in liminal magic are known as liminists. They've learned to tap into the mysticism at the heart of spaces between spaces and to bend the possibilities inherent in transitional moments to their own ends. Like filaments of a dream, strands of liminality can be woven into forms new and wondrous—or strange and terrifying.

### Level 2: Liminal Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a liminal spell (see the Magic and Spells chapter) into your spellbook is halved.

### Level 2: Mulligan
At 2nd level, you can control the moment between an attempt at something and the result of that attempt to shift the flow of battle in your favor. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you misses with an attack, you can use your reaction to allow that creature to reroll the attack. Similarly, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see hits with an attack but hasn't yet rolled damage, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll the attack and use the lower result. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

When you reach 10th level in this class, you can use this feature when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or saving throw.

### Level 6: Otherworldly Sense
At 6th level, if you spend 1 minute meditating and expanding your senses outward, you can sense those not of this world — those who slip through the cracks of the in-between to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting. For 10 minutes, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you: aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. As long as you maintain your concentration, you can use an action to change the type of creature you sense. You know the direction to each lone creature or group, but not the distance or the exact number in a group. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Liminal Adept
At 10th level, you add the threshold slip spell (see the Magic and Spells chapter) to your spellbook, if it isn't there already. You can cast threshold slip without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can bring up to two willing creatures of your size or smaller that you're touching with you. The target junction must have unoccupied spaces for all of you to enter when you reappear, or the spell fails.

You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting. When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature three times between resting.

### Level 14: Forced Transition
At 14th level, your mastery over moments of change is unequivocal. You can use an action to touch a willing creature or make a melee spell attack against an unwilling creature, choosing one of the following effects. The effect lasts for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a resting.

The target's ability scores are each increased by 2. An ability score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.

The target's ability scores are each reduced by 2. This effect can't reduce an ability score below 1.

The target can't change its shape through any means, including spells, such as polymorph, and traits, such as the werewolf 's Shapechanger trait. The target immediately reverts to its true form if it is currently in a different form. This option has no effect on illusion spells, such as disguise self, or a creature that appears changed from the effects of an illusion, such as a hag's Illusory Appearance.</description>

    <supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
    <description>Spellsmith (ToH)

### Level 2: Spellsmith
Some wizards pride themselves on being spell artisans, carefully sculpting the magical energy of spells like smiths sculpt iron. Focusing on the artistry inherent in spellcasting, these wizards learn to tap the magical energy of spells and manipulate that energy to amplify or modify spells like no other arcane practitioners.

### Level 2: Arcane Emendation
Beginning when you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you can manipulate the magical energy in scrolls to change the spells written on them. While holding a scroll, you can spend 1 hour for each level of the spell focusing on the magic within the scroll to change the spell on the scroll to another spell. The new spell must be of the same school, must be on the wizard spell list, and must be of the same or lower level than the original spell. If the new spell has any material components with a cost, you must provide those when changing the scroll's original spell to the new spell, and the components are consumed as the new spell's magic overwrites the original spell on the scroll.

### Level 2: Spell Transformation
At 2nd level, you learn to mold the latent magical energy of your spells to cast new spells. While concentrating on a wizard spell that you cast using a spell slot, you can use an action to end your concentration on that spell and use the energy to cast another wizard spell you have prepared without expending a spell slot. The new spell must be half the level (minimum of 1st) of the spell on which you were concentrating, and the new spell's casting time must be 1 action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 6: Spell Honing
At 6th level, you can hold onto the magic of lasting spells or siphon off some of their magic to amplify spells you cast. If your concentration is broken (willingly or unwillingly), the spell's magic lingers, causing the spell's effects to remain until the end of your next turn.

In addition, while concentrating on a spell with a duration of concentration up to 1 minute or concentration up to 10 minutes, you can amplify a wizard spell you cast of 1st level or higher. When you amplify a spell in this way, the duration of the spell on which you are concentrating is reduced by a number of rounds (if the duration is concentration up to 1 minute) or minutes (if the duration is concentration up to 10 minutes) equal to the amplified spell's level. You can choose only one of the following options when amplifying a spell:

Increase the saving throw DC by 2
Increase the spell attack bonus by 2
Add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of the spell.

You can amplify a spell this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a resting.

### Level 10: Spell Reversion
At 10th level, you learn to manipulate the magical energy of spells cast against you. When you must make a saving throw to end an ongoing effect, such as the frightened condition of the fear spell or the slowing effect of a copper dragon's slowing breath, you have advantage on the saving throw.

In addition, when an ongoing condition you successfully end on yourself was from a spell cast by a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make the same saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature suffers the effect or condition you just ended on yourself until the end of its next turn. For example, if you succeed on the saving throw to end the paralyzed condition on yourself from the hold person spell cast by a spellcaster you can see, you can force that spellcaster to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, and that spellcaster becomes paralyzed until the end of its next turn on a failed save.

### Level 14: Spell Duality
At 14th level, you become a master at manipulating and extending the magical energy of your long-lasting spells. You can concentration on two spells simultaneously. If you cast a third spell that requires concentration, you lose concentration on the oldest spell. When you take damage while concentrating on a spell and must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, you make one saving throw for each source of damage, as normal. You don't have to make one saving throw for each spell you are maintaining. If you are concentrating on two spells and fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration because of taking damage, you lose concentration on the oldest spell.

If you are concentrating on two spells and lose concentration on both spells in 1 round, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</description>
